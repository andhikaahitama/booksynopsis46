Her mother died when she was only ten, and since her father worked sunup to sundown on his farm, she became the cook for this family of five, teaching herself to cook Cajun specialties and learning to make the most of local ingredients. In 1949 she married Walter \u201cMoNeg\u201d Dor\u00e9, who worked for the McIlhenny Company, producer of Tabasco Brand Pepper Sauce. Soon the couple was put in charge of the Tabasco Company Commissary on Avery Island, which sold everything from bread to detergent and serviced both the McIlhenny Company employees and the McIlhenny family. It was Eula Mae who came up with the idea of selling sandwiches at lunchtime, and they soon became legendary, drawing businessmen from the mainland eight miles away. Besides cooking and managing the commissary, Eula Mae was often called on to prepare food for Walter McIlhenny, late owner of the McIlhenny Company. He often asked her to cook for parties and brunches, preferring her down-home cooking to that of his personal chef.Acadiana "Cajun" cooking, America's popular regional cuisine, is captured here by self-taught Dore, who has lived on Avery Island, La., since 1949. With her husband, she managed the Tabasco Company Commissary, cooking for the island's residents, visitors and owners, the McIlhenny family. The book, written with Bienvenu (a Cajun expert best known for co-authoring four books with Emeril Lagasse), is divided into seasons that reflect the rhythm of the island and the cyclical nature of the produce and ingredients used. Within each season, the recipes are divided into menus marking different events, from a May Wedding with Party Pecan Tarts using a flaky cream cheese pastry dough, through a Fourth of July Barbecue with its uncomplicated Commissary Cole Slaw and Eula Mae's Potato Salad (given a kick from Tabasco pepper sauce), to A Family Thanksgiving Feast with a simple Roasted Chicken. Brief descriptions before each recipe ("grits, for those of you not familiar with them, are simply finely ground corn") give the book a homey feel that echoes Dore's dishes, and the reminiscences that she sprinkles throughout add flavor and color to a book that brings this traditional regional style to kitchens everywhere. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Poiret Fashion Design Paper Dolls in Full Color</h2><p>This lavish tribute includes a costume designed for Mata Hari in 1913 and the famous lampshade tunic of black-and-white satin with pearl embroidery. 3 dolls, 29 beautifully rendered outfits.</p><p><p>One of the leading authorities on fashion history, Tom Tierney created over 150 paper doll books for Dover Publications.

One Unstoppable Movement.</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unforgettable chronicle of courage, determination, faith, and humility, Amazing Faith is the exclusive and inspiring account of how Dr. Bill Bright, founder and president of Campus Crusade for Christ International, stepped out in simple, unwavering obedience to God. Readers will delight in the extraordinary story of how an obedient Oklahoman left the ranch at God's urging, and how that obedience opened the door to reaching literally millions of lives with the message of Christ's love and the coming Kingdom.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Bright's formative years in the Midwest to the lonely struggles and all-too-human foibles of his early ministry...the founding of the unparalleled Campus Crusade movement to the explosive global outreaches of the new millennium...this authorized, behind-the-scenes biography leaves no stone unturned in its examination of a humble life remarkably used by God-a life which, by God's power, has made an impact on three billion souls.<br> Written by a retired investigative reporter who has closely followed the life and ministry of Dr. Bright for more than a decade, and with a foreword by Dr. Billy Graham, Amazing Faith uncovers the calling, the passion, the strategic thinking, the sacrifice, and the astounding impact of one man committed to bold evangelism, disciple-ship, and the fulfillment of the Great Commission in his lifetime.<br><br> "He's just the kind of man I had in mind when I started the program twenty-five years ago because he's an example to everybody of all religions that it's possible to have progress in religion." -Sir John Templeton, founder of the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, which Dr. Bill Bright was awarded in 1996. He donated the $1 million honorarium to support a national movement of prayer and fasting.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was merely one man - a shy, faithful, intense man. Educated and polished, yet humble and patient, a man forever gripped by the call to change the world with the love of God. Finally, in this fascinating, in-depth new biography, you can relive the challenging life story of Bill Bright, the simple man about whose life work The Los Angeles Times religion editor wrote, "No movement of our time is likely to have a more healthy impact upon the life of our nation than the movement founded and headed by Bill Bright."</p><p>Near the beginning of <i>Amazing Faith: The Authorized Biography of Bill Bright</i>, author Michael Richardson writes about Bright's founding of Campus Crusade for Christ, one of the largest Christian organizations in the world. Richardson quotes Bright as saying, "I'm often asked if I'm surprised at the remarkable growth and size of Campus Crusade for Christ. My answer: No, I am not surprised, for the vision God gave that midnight hour in the spring of 1951 was of such great magnitude--far greater than anything we have yet experienced. The best is yet before us." Bright's single-minded commitment to evangelism fills every detail of his days--he even signs his letters "Yours for fulfilling the Great Commission in this generation." And <i>Amazing Faith</i> is an intimate, easy-to-read account of Bright's extremely popular ministry. Most chapters are less than five pages long, and they are written in a style that is straightforward and down to earth. The biographer had excellent access to information about the friendships between Bright and Christian leaders such as Billy Graham, his home life and his relationship with his wife Vonette, and all the highlights of his career (including winning the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion in 1996). His biographer, in return, has given Bright--and readers--a comprehensive, entertaining, and inspiring book.<b>High Acclaim for the Man behind Amazing Faith:<br>The Authorized Biography of Bill Bright</b><br><br>"No movement of our time is likely to have a more healthy impact upon the life of our nation than the movement founded and headed by Bill Bright."<br>Religion Editor, The Los Angeles Times<br> "He has reached people in a depth and number matched by few in history--He brings great power to his message because he 'walks his talk.'

But what begins as a bon voyage party soon becomes a bitter, claustrophobic clash of family resentment. From the hotel room to the tiny restaurant to which the five embark, Laura presides over the escalating innuendo and hostility with imperial cruelty, for she is hiding the knowledge that her mother, the family matriarch, has died of a heart attack that morning. Intense and unerringly observed, The Widow&#39;s Children is a tour de force from the incomparable Paula Fox.</p><p>First published in 1976, <i>The Widow's Children</i>, with its unpalatable family wistfully gnashing at one another, has long defied critical description. Now that it's been rereleased, with a fine new introduction by Andrea Barrett, it's time again for readers to approach this spare--yet unsparing--novel. Approach with something like terror, or at least a tremulous respect, for Paula Fox's tale of one family's massive, various history awes with its marvelous compression. We learn these people inside and out in just one evening. Divided into seven chapters ("Drinks," "Corridor," "Restaurant," "The Messenger," "Two Brothers," "Clara," "The Funeral"), the book tells of the Maldonadas, Spanish-Cuban immigrants to America who now find themselves middle-aged and living in the past, galvanized only by sister Laura's emotional excesses. "These people," notes Peter, a friend, "had not signed <i>any</i> social contract."<p> Laura leads her husband, Desmond, her brother, Carlos, her daughter, Clara, and Peter a not-so-merry dance through one acrimonious dinner in a pretentious Manhattan restaurant. Practically the only ugly truth she doesn't manage to dredge up is the one she learned that very afternoon: Alma, Carlos and Laura's mother, has died in a nursing home. But the plot is not what we think about when we say this is a very, very good novel. Fox's marvelous control and formalism ultimately give <i>The Widow's Children</i> its strange, singular power. She has a poet's ability not just to imply unsayable mysteries but to imbue the unsaid with treachery, wit, emotion, and irony, all hanging in a vaporous cloud. Each character in turns speaks a pained monologue; we don't like them--we don't, in a sense, even care--but we can't stop watching this elaborately choreographed car wreck.</p><p> Along the way, Fox gets off a number of good ones, as in this description of a neighbor: "a tall muscular man who entered into and departed from rooms quickly, athletically, as though following a secret program of body building." Her wit leavens our impatience with these difficult people. And that's a clever swindle, for she then delivers a chilling tale with infinite grace. This is in no way an expected novel. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>Paula Fox is the author of six novels, including Desperate Characters, The Widow&#39;s Children, and Poor George.

With the spirit of a true outdoorsman, Chuck demonstrates how the outdoors, in so many ways, fulfills Romans 1:20; &#34;For since the creation of the world, God&#39;s invisible qualities-his eternal power and divine nature-have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made...:(NIV).Chuck&#39;s writing is powerful, simple and timely:&#34;some call it Mother Nature. Some call it the great outdoors. Regardless of what you call it, if you spend much time outside, you&#39;ll quickly notice that the fingerprint of God is unmistakably on chreation... That means we can learn some powerful lessons about life from creation, from the beauty, the majesty, and the wonder of the great outdoors-the adventure of being out in God&#39;s world.&#34;</p><p>For years, I have loved the outdoors: the majesty of snow covered peaks, the persistence of a stream rushing its way to the ocean, the ominous gathering of a storm in the distance, the quiet simplicity of a walk in the woods, the peaceful feeling of gazing at a cobalt blue sky, the awe of watching a massive buck move stealthily through the forest, or the explosion of a cackling pheasant as it moves skyward. &nbsp;I am more alive outdoors than anywhere else. Countless numbers of people who pursue the adventure of the outdoors share this sentiment. What causes that response?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I think Job, in the Bible, answers that question best. &nbsp;He was struggling. &nbsp;He had lost everything, even his health, when his so-called friends showed up and began to criticize him. Job fired back:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But now ask the beasts and they will teach you; and the birds of the air, and they will tell you; or speak to the earth, and it will teach you; and the fish of the sea will explain to you. Who among all these does not know the hand of the Lord has done this, in whose hand is the life of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind." &nbsp;(Job 12:7-10)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The outdoors draws us because that is where we can get in touch with something, or Someone, much bigger than ourselves. &nbsp;This book helps identify some of the ways in which the Lord, who has created all, makes Himself Known. &nbsp;Whether God gives us glimpses of Himself in the helplessness of a new born fawn, the complex communication system of a calling crow, or the breathtaking panorama of a giant mountain, we should recognize that God has done all this, and He wants to take you on exciting adventures in His country. &nbsp;I hope this book helps.&nbsp;Sincerely His,&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Chuck McAlister</i>"In his book, <i>Adventures in God's Country</i>, Chuck McAlister does a superb job blending the truths of scripture and the wonders of nature. &nbsp;His great insight, intimate relationship with Jesus Christ and love of the outdoors is evident in this easily understood and informative devotional. This book is a powerful witnessing tool and a must for any outdoors enthusiast!" &nbsp;Tammy Koenig - <i>Leading Ladies Outdoors - </i>leadingladiesoutdoors.comChuck's writing is powerful, simple and timely:"Some call it Mother Nature. &nbsp;Some call it the great outdoors. &nbsp;Regardless of what you call it, if you spend much time outside, you'll quickly notice that the fingerprint of God is unmistakably on creation...That means we can learn some powerful lessons about life from creation, from the beauty, the majesty, and the wonder of the great outdoors--the adventure of being out in God's world."</p><h2>The Last Princess: The Story of Princess Kaiulani of Hawaii</h2><p>A welcome reissue of an award-winning title--and the author&#39;s only children&#39;s book--recounts the story of Hawaii&#39;s last heir to the throne, who was denied her right to rule when the monarchy was abolished. An ALA Notable Book.</p><p>Fay Stanley, Diane Stanley's mother, was the author of suspense novels and short stories for adults. <em>The Last Princess: the Story of Princess Ka'iulani of Hawai'i,</em> was her only children's book.Grade 3-6-- Diane Stanley's newest picture biography with a text by her mother is the story of Princess Ka'iulani of Hawai'i. Expected to one day become queen, she is sent to England to be educated, only to have the haoles (foreigners) threaten her family's right to rule. Although her courageous plea to President Grover Cleveland postponed the end of Hawaii's independence, the islands were annexed by the United States in 1897. The beautiful Princess Ka'iulani died only 2 years later at the age of 23. As with Stanley's other biographies, readers are transported into another very believable world. The full-page paintings are stunning, reflecting the beauty of the islands and the handsome, racially mixed people who live there. Although her style evolves and adapts somewhat to her material, the book has an unmistakably Stanley look. A helpful note on the Hawaiian language and an extensive bibliography complete this visual treat. --Ann Stell, The Smithtown Library, NY<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dutch Sneakers and Flea Keepers: 14 More Stories</h2><p>In the tradition of Edward Lear, Calef Brown has fashioned fourteen nonsense poems so wacky that both young and old will be unable to suppress their laughter. Invented words and sounds and their visual counterparts create both an audible and a visual feast. This is the kind of silliness children (and many adults) relish.</p><p>The creator of <i>Polkabats and Octopus Slacks</i> puts his playful pen to paper again in <i>Dutch Sneakers and Fleakeepers</i>. Calef Brown's story-poems are nonsensical and exuberant, and his muted, sophisticated Cubist paintings join the party with equal zeal. Did you know that fleas "learn to speak German / more quickly than bees"? Or that "bad teeth" aren't really bad, they just need "a cleaning and something to chew"? No, resist the impulse to look for lessons: Brown--a hip, modern Edward Lear--is here to have fun. Children will adore meeting the feared "Tattlesnake" (with unusual stripes and big ears), an electric-guitar-playing grandmother, a runaway waffle, a mysterious fish ("Green like asparagus. / Flat like a dish"), Sir Dance-a-lot, and the rest of Brown's crazy--yes, crazy--cast of characters.

He lives in Maine.</p><h2>A Very Dangerous Woman: Martha Wright and Women&#39;s Rights</h2><p>"A very dangerous woman" is what Martha Coffin Wright's conservative neighbors considered her, because of her work in the women's rights and abolition movements. In 1848, Wright and her older sister Lucretia Mott were among the five brave women who organized the historic Seneca Falls Women's Rights Convention. Wright remained a prominent figure in the women's movement until her death in 1875 at age sixty-eight, when she was president of the National Woman Suffrage Association. At age twenty-six, she attended the 1833 founding of the American Anti-Slavery Society and later presided over numerous antislavery meetings, including two in 1861 that were disrupted by angry antiabolitionist mobs. Active in the Underground Railroad, she sheltered fugitive slaves and was a close friend and supporter of Harriet Tubman. <br><br>In telling Wright's story, the authors make good use of her lively letters to her family, friends, and colleagues, including Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. These letters reveal Wright's engaging wit and offer an insider's view of nineteenth-century reform and family life. Her correspondence with slaveholding relatives in the South grew increasingly contentious with the approach of the Civil War. One nephew became a hero of the Confederacy with his exploits at the Battle of Fredericksburg, and her son in the Union artillery was seriously wounded at Gettysburg while repelling Pickett's Charge. <br><br>Wright's life never lacked for drama. She survived a shipwreck, spent time at a frontier fort, experienced the trauma of the deaths of a fianc�, her first husband, and three of her seven children, and navigated intense conflicts within the women's rights and abolition movements. Throughout her tumultuous career, she drew on a reservoir of humor to promote her ideas and overcome the many challenges she faced.

His baffling conclusion: that it is the work of the Illuminati, a secret brotherhood presumed extinct for nearly four h</p><p>It takes guts to write a novel that combines an ancient secret brotherhood, the Swiss Conseil Europ�en pour la Recherche Nucl�aire, a papal conclave, mysterious ambigrams, a plot against the Vatican, a mad scientist in a wheelchair, particles of antimatter, jets that can travel 15,000 miles per hour, crafty assassins, a beautiful Italian physicist, and a Harvard professor of religious iconology. It takes talent to make that novel anything but ridiculous. Kudos to Dan Brown (<i>Digital Fortress</i>) for achieving the nearly impossible. Angels &amp; Demons is a no-holds-barred, pull-out-all-the-stops, breathless tangle of a thriller--think Katherine Neville's <i>The Eight</i> (but cleverer) or Umberto Eco's <i>Foucault's Pendulum</i> (but more accessible). <p></p> Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is shocked to find proof that the legendary secret society, the Illuminati--dedicated since the time of Galileo to promoting the interests of science and condemning the blind faith of Catholicism--is alive, well, and murderously active. Brilliant physicist Leonardo Vetra has been murdered, his eyes plucked out, and the society's ancient symbol branded upon his chest. His final discovery, antimatter, the most powerful and dangerous energy source known to man, has disappeared--only to be hidden somewhere beneath Vatican City on the eve of the election of a new pope. Langdon and Vittoria, Vetra's daughter and colleague, embark on a frantic hunt through the streets, churches, and catacombs of Rome, following a 400-year-old trail to the lair of the Illuminati, to prevent the incineration of civilization. <p></p> Brown seems as much juggler as author--there are lots and lots of balls in the air in this novel, yet Brown manages to hurl the reader headlong into an almost surreal suspension of disbelief. While the reader might wish for a little more sardonic humor from Langdon, and a little less bombastic philosophizing on the eternal conflict between religion and science, these are less fatal flaws than niggling annoyances--readers should have no trouble skimming past them and immersing themselves in a heck of a good read. "Brain candy" it may be, but my! It's tasty. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i> <br><br> <p><strong>Look Inside the Motion Picture <i>Angels &amp; Demons</i> (Sony Pictures, 2009) </strong><br> Click on each image below to see a larger view<br><br> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><br> Ewan MacGregor as Carlo Ventresca with College of Cardinals</p></td> <td> <p><br> Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon </p></td> </tr></tbody></table><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><br> Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon and Ayelet Zurer as Vittoria Vetra</p></td> <td> <p><br> Armin Mueller-Stahl as Straus and Ewan MacGregor as Carlo Ventresca </p></td> </tr></tbody></table> <p></p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><br> Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon, Ayelet Zurer as Vittoria Vetra, and Ewan MacGregor as Carlo Ventresca</p></td> <td> <p><br> Ewan MacGregor as Carlo Ventresca </p></td></tr></tbody></table> <p></p>World-renowned Harvard symboligist Robert Langdon is summoned to a Swiss research facility to analyze a cryptic symbol seared into the chest of a murdered physicist.

For the British there, life is orderly and genteel. Then the sepoys at the nearest military cantonment rise in revolt and the British community retreats with shock into the Residency. They prepare to fight for their lives with what weapons they can muster. As food and ammunition grow short, the Residency, its defences battered by shot and shell and eroded by the rains, becomes ever more vulnerable.The Siege of Krishnapur is a modern classic of narrative excitement that also digs deep to explore some fundamental questions of civilisation and life.</p><p><i>"The first sign of trouble at Krishnapur came with a mysterious distribution of chapatis, made of coarse flour and about the size and thickness of a biscuit; towards the end of February 1857, they swept the countryside like an epidemic."</i> <p> Students of history will recognize 1857 as the year of the Sepoy rebellion in India--an uprising of native soldiers against the British, brought on by Hindu and Muslim recruits' belief that the rifle cartridges they were provided had been greased with pig or cow fat. This seminal event in Anglo-Indian relations provides the backdrop for J.G. Farrell's Booker Prize-winning exploration of race, culture, and class, <i>The Siege of Krishnapur</i>. </p><p> Like the mysteriously appearing chapatis, life in British India seems, on the surface, innocuous enough. Farrell introduces us gradually to a large cast of characters as he paints a vivid portrait of the Victorians' daily routines that are accompanied by heat, boredom, class consciousness, and the pursuit of genteel pastimes intended for cooler climates. Even the siege begins slowly, with disquieting news of massacres in cities far away. When Krishnapur itself is finally attacked, the Europeans withdraw inside the grounds of the Residency where very soon conditions begin to deteriorate: food and water run out, disease is rampant, people begin to go a little mad. Soon the very proper British are reduced to eating insects and consorting across class lines. Farrell's descriptions of life inside the Residency are simultaneously horrifying and blackly humorous. The siege, for example, is conducted under the avid eyes of the local populace, who clearly anticipate an enjoyable massacre and thus arrive every morning laden with picnic lunches (plainly visible to the starving Europeans). By turns witty and compassionate, <i>The Siege of Krishnapur</i> comprises the best of all fictional worlds: unforgettable characters, an epic adventure, and at its heart a cultural clash for the ages. Quite simply, this is a splendid novel. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>J.G. Farrell was born in Liverpool in 1935 and spent a good deal of his life abroad, including periods in France and North America, and then settled in London where he wrote most of his novels.Among his novels, TROUBLES won the Faber Memorial Prize in 1970 and the Lost Man Booker prize in 2010 and THE SIEGE OF KRISHNAPUR won the Booker Prize in 1973.In April 1979 he went to live in County Cork where only four months later he was drowned in a fishing accident.</p><h2>Lenny: A Play, Based on the Life and Words of Lenny Bruce (Evergreen Black Cat B-355)</h2><p>Evergreen Black Cat #B-355.

But on Christmas Day, he goes out to play a round of golf, and for the first time, he finds himself in the "zone". He sees the putting line that has eluded him for years. Always a fairly good golfer, he finds himself playing like a pro and is so caught up in his excitement that he continues to play, sinking putt after putt, missing Christmas dinner with his wife and family. It is too much for his already troubled marriage.<br><br>His family collapes - but Travis is soon too busy living his dream to notice. His amazing new golf skills catapult him into the PGA Senior Open at Pebble Beach, where he advances to the final round with two of his heroes, Jack Nicklaus and Raymond Floyd. And with his wife, children,and a live television audience watching, a miracle takes place on the 17th green that will change Travis, and his family, forever.</strong></p><p>James B. Patterson (born March 22, 1947) is an award-winning American author. Formerly an advertising executive for J. W. Thompson in the early 1990s, Patterson came up with the slogan &#34;Toys R Us Kid&#34;. Shortly after his success with Along Came A Spider he retired from the firm and devoted his time to writing. The novels featuring his character, Alex Cross, a black forensic psychologist formerly of the Washington, D.C. Police Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation, now working as a private psychologist and government consultant, are the most popular books among Patterson readers. James Patterson has been criticized by Stephen King, who called Patterson&#39;s books &#34;dopey thrillers&#34;.[citation needed] Patterson shrugged off the comments, stating that he wants to be the &#34;thrillingest thriller writer of all time&#34;.[citation needed] James Patterson has also been put as one of Forbes magazine&#39;s top 100 celebrities.While it isn't quite the literary equivalent of a hole-in-one, this fast-moving golf fantasy about an amateur golfer who decides to try out for the PGA Senior Tour has enough sweetness and humor to overcome its obvious plot cliches. Middle-aged and happily married, Travis McKinley does the unthinkable: he misses Christmas dinner after getting caught up in a divinely inspired streak of great putting during an outing on the country club course in Winnetka, Ill. As Travis's obsession with his newfound talent takes over his life, his obstetrician wife, Sarah, expresses increasing dismay over his inability to grow up, a domestic crisis that reaches a boiling point when Travis loses his job and journeys to Tallahassee, Fla., to try to qualify for the Senior Tour. Competing against overwhelming odds, Travis earns a place on the tour, only to have his dream spoiled when he learns that Sarah intends to file for divorce. As he continues to compete against the likes of Jack Nicklaus and Lee Trevino, the victory that will fulfill Travis's dream and reunite him with his family is as improbable as it is inevitable. Plot issues aside, Patterson (whose newest thriller is Jack and Jill) and de Jonge succeed admirably in creating a winning character who is enough of a child to believe his dreams and is also mature enough to offer some gently humorous reflections on our national obsession with an engaging sport.

Jackson Book Prize from the Foundation for Landscape Studies <p>"In the course of my research," writes D. Fairchild Ruggles, "I devoured Arabic agricultural manuals from the tenth through the fourteenth centuries. I love gardening, and in these texts I was able to enter the minds of agriculturalists and botanists of a thousand years ago who likewise believed it was important and interesting to record all the known ways of propagating olive trees, the various uses of rosemary, and how best to fertilize a garden bed."</p><p>Western admirers have long seen the Islamic garden as an earthly reflection of the paradise said to await the faithful. However, such simplification, Ruggles contends, denies the sophistication and diversity of the art form. <i>Islamic Gardens and Landscapes</i> immerses the reader in the world of the architects of the great gardens of the Islamic world, from medieval Morocco to contemporary India.</p><p>Just as Islamic culture is historically dense, sophisticated, and complex, so too is the history of its built landscapes. Islamic gardens began from the practical need to organize the surrounding space of human civilization, tame nature, enhance the earth's yield, and create a legible map on which to distribute natural resources. Ruggles follows the evolution of these early farming efforts to their aristocratic apex in famous formal gardens of the Alhambra in Spain and the Taj Mahal in Agra.</p><p>Whether in a humble city home or a royal courtyard, the garden has several defining characteristics, which Ruggles discusses. Most notable is an enclosed space divided into four equal parts surrounding a central design element. The traditional Islamic garden is inwardly focused, usually surrounded by buildings or in the form of a courtyard. Water provides a counterpoint to the portioned green sections.</p><p>Ranging across poetry, court documents, agronomy manuals, and early garden representations, and richly illustrated with pictures and site plans, <i>Islamic Gardens and Landscapes</i> is a book of impressive scope sure to interest scholars and enthusiasts alike.</p></p><p>D. Fairchild Ruggles is Associate Professor of Landscape History at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the author of Gardens, Landscape, and Vision in the Palaces of Islamic Spain.<p>Preface</p><p>Gardens are at once highly meaningful, expressing the position of humankind with respect to the earth and cosmos, and utterly ordinary, reflecting the need to produce a food crop in order to survive the fallow season and plant anew another year. Moreover, the urge to garden, to domesticate the wild landscape by clearing it of all but selected plants, watering them, and tending them until they flower and bear fruit, is a basic human endeavor that requires few resources and no grand conceptual scheme. Although gardens and landscape works requiring complex irrigation or drainage systems may occur on a large scale and reflect either the ambition of kings or the ability of a community to organize itself, others are quite humble and occur spontaneously.</p><p>This book looks thematically at Islamic gardens and cultivated landscapes, placing them on a continuous spectrum with the city and architecture at one end and nature and wilderness at the other. The Islamic garden is a popular theme among architects and enthusiasts, and every year a new volume is produced with handsome illustrations of stunning gardens. However, a great many of these focus entirely on elite formal gardens, defining them as enclosed spaces that are geometrically laid out and interpreting their symbolic meaning narrowly as "paradise on earth." The removal of the garden from the broader context of landscape, agriculture, and water supply results in a limited and superficial view, giving extraordinary emphasis to religion and dynastic politics while ignoring other factors that contributed equally to garden form and meaning.</p><p>This is not a book about the origins of the Islamic garden or its formal properties. Unlike Islamic architecture&#x2014;where we can observe highly recognizable forms in mosque, palace, and tomb design&#x2014;in Islamic history there is really only one formal garden plan, with a few variations on it. This is the so-called <i>chahar bagh</i>, or the four-part garden laid out with axial walkways that intersect in the garden center, discussed in Chapter 4, and the various stepped terrace variations of it that proliferated in the Safavid and Mughal realms, discussed in Chapter 10 and throughout.</p><p>Gardens begin as secular endeavors, stemming from the practical need to organize the surrounding space, tame nature, enhance the earth's yield, and create a legible map on which to distribute natural resources. Three early chapters address these practical issues. Symbolic interpretations of the meaning of such domestication and fertility came later in the history of garden making, so that the good garden became a sign of human success, and a productive landscape a sign of divine favor. There have been several inspiring theological interpretations of gardens as signs of paradise for Muslims, but the evidence suggests that the actual early gardens were not regarded thus. In this respect, it is important to remember that while theology and history both seek the truth, they ask and answer different questions. With respect to the built environment and the interpretation of it, the questions that I attempt to answer here are purely historical.</p><p>One of the traps that writers about Islamic gardens often fall into is the emphasis on extant gardens, interpreting the historic past by means of easily visible and attractive gardens that have not been explored archaeologically and whose plantings are historically inaccurate. For instance, the Generalife Palace's Patio de la Acequ�a in Granada has been celebrated as a living and authentic Islamic garden, when in fact its soil levels and plantings are entirely modern. Among architects, historians, and site conservators there is a regrettable tolerance for botanical inaccuracy at historic sites, despite the fact that we now have an array of archaeological techniques to identify many of the plants and trees that were once grown there. Examples of successful garden archaeology help explain what we can and cannot learn about gardens from such approaches in combination with written texts and painted representations of gardens.</p><p>Equally problematic are the attempts to interpret the real gardens of this earth through the shimmering veil of Arabic and especially Persian verse; lacking historical reference and archaeological data, these are more successful as studies of poetry than as descriptions of actual gardens. The Taj Mahal has been studied thus: the references to judgment and the Throne of God in its program of inscriptions have prompted scholars to interpret the monument in compelling theological and political terms. But these Qur'anic inscriptions explain neither the unusual position of the tomb in the garden nor the relationship of the Taj complex to the pleasure garden on the river's opposite bank.</p><p>Finally, the garden form was such a powerful artistic form in many areas of the Islamic world that it was adopted by non-Muslims&#x2014;such as the Rajputs of Mughal India&#x2014;as a way of expressing alliance with Muslim rulers and thereby indicating a shared cultural identity that transcended their more obvious religious differences. The garden was not an exclusively Muslim production; it arose from a specific climate and set of techniques for controlling the landscape and thus reflected regional concerns that were common to all the peoples sharing that landscape. The point here is not that the garden was produced outside of religious and cultural contexts&#x2014;indeed, the transformation of landscape is one of the most powerful expressions of the human experience, the awe at regarding the cosmos, and the fear and hope at contemplating death. But it is a fundamental argument of this book that neither religion nor culture alone can explain the meaning, mechanics, and productivity of that set of gardens that historians, in retrospect, label "Islamic."</p><p>Perhaps because the history of Islamic gardens was written, until quite recently, by persons who were outsiders to Islamic religion and culture, the range of scholarship on gardens varies from a kind of a historicity to insulting stereotypes. While the worst of such endeavors can be dismissed as outrageous orientalist fantasy, one must wonder whether, in trying to recreate the experience of landscapes and inhabitants that vanished long ago, any historian is liable to project his or her own desires and expectations. For myself, I am aware of the attraction of representing Islamic Spain and Mughal India as successful melting pots of ethnicity and religion, as if the mingling of Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Judaism in those cultures could instruct the modern world. Cultural diversity and difference was a signal characteristic of the early Islamic world; yet while gardens reveal the diversity of plant material, their more powerful dimension is continuity. The evidence clearly shows that, while agriculture is deeply affected by political strife, the actual practice more often than not transcends political, religious, and ethnic boundaries. For this reason, it is almost impossible to distinguish between gardens made for Muslim and for Christian patrons in southern Spain in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. In general, agricultural innovations are quickly adopted when the benefits are recognized, provided the political and cultural climate allows it.</p><p>The book extends from the seventh through the twentieth centuries. Although the earliest chapters begin with the advent of Islam, they do not follow a strictly historical progression through the various successive dynasties. Instead, thematic grouping of issues in which subjects such as mythic gardens (Chapter 7) and manuscript representations (Chapter 6) are explored without trying to arrange all the sites in question into a neat chronological framework. The book focuses somewhat more on the landscapes of South Asia and Islamic Spain than elsewhere, partly because these areas have outstanding examples of extant gardens that have been well studied by historians and archaeologists, and partly because I am most familiar with these areas of the world. It does not extend into Southeast Asia or beyond Africa's northern coast simply because there is so little information on landscape design in those areas and because what material does exist belongs largely to the recent centuries, an era for which there is a surfeit of sites and gardens. The bookends with a list of Islamic Garden and Sites by geographical region, selected because they are historically important, well preserved, or representative in some way (especially in the case of nineteenth- and twentieth-century residential gardens, which are too numerous to list). Each garden and site in this section is illustrated by a plan or photograph and is followed by a brief bibliography.</p><p>For this volume I have supplied more than eighty plans, many corrected or redrawn for the first time. The ground plan is a useful tool for spatial analysis, but it reduces landscape to a world of architecture, plotted on flat paper, often with no indication of the topographic contours or ground water systems that may have been the principal determining factors in the garden's layout. Typically the garden is represented as distinct from the rest of the landscape, with only a minimal indication of whether it stands amidst a desert or a forest, on a mountain top or a plain. Other shortcomings are that ground plans tend to show the garden in its original conceptual state, perhaps the only moment when a plan has any real meaning. Conversely, sections or views may envision the garden in an imaginary future moment when trees have matured and seasonal plants are in bloom. Nevertheless, given the lack of alternatives, I have reluctantly reproduced many such plans in the present volume. Most of the gardens discussed in the book appear in the later Gardens and Sites section, and readers should consult the plans that accompany these descriptions as they read the chapters. The terms "Islamic" and "Muslim" appear throughout but are not interchangeable. The term "Muslim" refers to the believers of Islam, the religion conveyed by God through the Prophet Muhammad. It can also serve as a descriptor for mosques, practices, and concepts that directly reflect the religion. In contradistinction, the term "Islamic" is used broadly to refer to a community of Muslims as well as the set of social practices and material forms&#x2014;their culture&#x2014;that characterized not only these religious adherents but also the non-Muslims living in their midst. Hence, cities such as seventh-century Jerusalem, eighth-century Cordoba, late fifteenth-century Istanbul, and sixteenth-century Agra can be called Islamic, because they were ruled by Muslim governments that ensured the hegemony of Islamic cultural values. However, in each case, there were large numbers of non-Muslims&#x2014;Byzantines and Jews in Jerusalem, and the adherents to the various sects that together are called Hinduism in Agra, for example. These lived in a predominantly Islamic culture and in some cases adopted many of the external signs of that culture, without departing from the beliefs of their own faith or renouncing their identity as Christian, Jew, or Hindu. Thus the religious term "Muslim" is a subset of the larger cultural rubric "Islamic."</p><p>Common era dates are used throughout, except where cited as hijra dates (H, the Islamic era) in primary sources. For the sake of clarity, especially for Western readers, Arabic, Persian, and Turkish words are pluralized with an "s."</p></p><h2>Israel: A History</h2><p><p>Israel is a small and relatively young country, but since the day of its creation sixty years ago, its turbulent history has placed it at the centre of the world stage. In this new edition of <em>Israel: A History?revised and including two new chapters to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the state?s creation?Sir Martin Gilbert traces Israel?s history from the struggles of its pioneers in the nineteenth century to the present day. Along the way, he describes the defining moments in the history of the Jewish people, among them the Balfour Declaration of 1917, the United Nations Partition Resolution of 1947, and the founding of the State of Israel in 1948. <br><br> The desire for statehood long preceded the declaration of the State; for two millennia the Jews, dispersed all over the world, prayed for a return to Zion. The prayer ?Next Year in Jerusalem? seemed a fantasy, until Theodor Herzl, in the last decade of the nineteenth century, transformed Zionism into a modern political movement. Soon the earlier trickle of Jewish immigrants turned into a flood as Jews sought fulfillment of their national aspirations or fled persecution in Europe. <br><br> The declaration of Statehood in May 1948 and the War of Independence were only the beginning of the drama. Israel?s subsequent development was dominated by the conflicts of Suez, the Six Day War, the October War, the Lebanon War, and the Intifada, as well as by diplomatic watersheds?from the early armistice agreements to the Camp David negotiations, the Madrid conference, and the Oslo peace process. Guiding us through the events that have shaped modern-day Israel, Gilbert examines not only Israel?s political history and personalities from Ben-Gurion to Rabin, Peres, and Netanyahu, but also its society, culture, and economy. <br><br> Basing his narrative on a wealth of contemporary documents and eyewitness accounts, as well as on his own intimate knowledge of the country, Martin Gilbert provides a riveting and moving account of the history of Israel. <em>Israel: A History will be essential reading on the nation?s sixtieth anniversary. <br><br> Praise for, <em>Israel: A History: <br><br> <strong>?Gilbert?s impassioned history adds immeasurably to our understanding of the forces that have shaped contemporary Israel.

Gilbert?s extensive behind-the-scenes and on-the-battlefield coverage of Israel?s numerous wars with its Arab neighbors adds much new detail. While the narrative focuses predominantly on politics, high-level diplomacy and war, it also illuminates other topics, including the Jewish settlement of Palestine in the early years of this century, tensions between secularists and Orthodox Jews, Israeli military intelligence operations, the current impasse in negotiations with Palestinian Arabs and the ferment of Israeli society, which Gilbert portrays as a diverse mixture of immigrant peoples that embody many different strands of Judaism yet are united by Israeli culture.? ?<em>Publishers Weekly</em></em></strong></em></em></em></p></p><p>For Israel�s 60th anniversary, a completely updated new edition of Martin Gilbert�s classic history. <p>Israel is a small and relatively young country, but its turbulent history has placed it squarely at the centre of the world stage.During two millennia the Jews, dispersed all over the world, prayed for a return to Zion.Until the nineteenth century, that dream seemed a fantasy, but then a secular Zionist movement was born and soon the initial trickle of Jewish immigrants to Palestine turned into a flood as Jews fled persecution in Europe.From these beginnings, Martin Gilbert traces the events and personalities that would lead to the dramatic declaration of Statehood in May 1948. </p> <p>From that point on, Israel's history has been dominated by conflict: Suez, the Six Day War, the Yom Kippur War, the Lebanon and the Intifada.Using contemporary documents and eyewitness accounts, drawing on his own intimate knowledge of the country and its people, Martin Gilbert weaves together a seamless, page-turning history of a powerful and proud nation, and adds two new chapters to cover the last ten years, bringing the story up to date: the continuing conflicts, internal and external; the persistent plans and negotiations; and the ever-present avenues of hope. </p> <p>�Rich in detail . . . a grand, heroic narrative� Times Literary Supplement �A superlative history of Israel� Jonathan Sacks, The Times</p><br> <b>MARTIN GILBERT</b> is the author of more than seventy books and a leading historian of the modern world. <br> Gilbert was born in London in 1936.

Jas said Dad would kill Flora if she broke the oar, and Flora said she&#x2019;d remember that when her entire family had been murdered because she hadn&#x2019;t been properly armed. But in the end we didn&#x2019;t need to hit the burglar, because when we got to the kitchen he turned out to be Zoran, and even though we didn&#x2019;t know yet that it was him, he was wearing a flowery apron and sandals and a little goatee that made him look like Mr. Tumnus in <i>Narnia</i>, who everybody knows was on the right side in the end, even if he did have his moments.</p><p>&#x201c;Who are you and what are you doing here?&#x201d; demanded Flora.</p><p>&#x201c;I am your new babysitter,&#x201d; said Zoran.</p><p>&#x201c;A babysitter!&#x201d; cried Flora. &#x201c;But why?&#x201d;</p><p>Zoran gave Jas what Dad calls <i>a laden look</i>, and she bit her lip so we couldn&#x2019;t see the stitches they gave her at the hospital.</p><p>&#x201c;Your mother called me last night,&#x201d; said Zoran. &#x201c;She was worried.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But how does she even <i>know </i>you?&#x201d; asked Flora.</p><p>We all stared at him. It seemed so unlikely that Mum would know someone like Zoran.</p><p>&#x201c;Through your father,&#x201d; said Zoran.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Flora.</p><p>And that was that. Zoran didn&#x2019;t elaborate and we didn&#x2019;t ask.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s tidy up, shall we?&#x201d; he said instead. &#x201c;Then we can all have breakfast.&#x201d;</p><p>His shoulders drooped a bit when he said the tidying up bit and looking around the kitchen, I have to say I could see why. Flora keeps her room tidy but treats the rest of the house like a squat. The rest of us just squat.</p><p>&#x201c;Does <i>anybody</i> do the dishes?&#x201d; Zoran gazed up at the ceiling when he said that, like God might actually care.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re only last night&#x2019;s,&#x201d; said Flora.</p><p>Zoran smirked as he picked up a stack of plates. I could have warned him, but I didn&#x2019;t. He took one step backward, landed on Twig&#x2019;s remote-controlled Aston Martin DB2/4 Competition Spider, and vanished in a crash of china.</p><br>------------------------------<br><p>Zoran announced he had concussion. The Babes (aka Twig and Jas) sat cross-legged at his feet and cut bandages out of a sheet they found in the washing machine, which Flora wound around his head while they explained about the Aston Martin.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re for the rats,&#x201d; said Jas. &#x201c;We have three. White, with pink eyes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We use Daddy&#x2019;s ties to strap them in, and then we race them,&#x201d; said Twig. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got lots of different models. The Spider&#x2019;s mine but it&#x2019;s okay because you didn&#x2019;t damage it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a Jag XK120,&#x201d; said Jas. &#x201c;The rats love it, they really do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There!&#x201d; Flora stopped winding and turned Zoran toward the mirror.</p><p>Zoran gasped. Jas started to cry because laughing stretched her stitches. Twig snorted so hard snot came out of his nose.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh my <i>God</i>!&#x201d; cried Zoran. &#x201c;I look like an Egyptian mummy!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You said you were concussed!&#x201d; protested Flora.</p><p>Zoran looked cross but Flora gave him her scrunched-up nose grin, the one that makes her look like she&#x2019;s about ten years old instead of sixteen. Nobody can ever resist that grin.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you for rescuing me,&#x201d; Zoran grumbled.</p><p>Flora started to laugh then, too, and then they were all laughing, except Zoran laughed less than the others.</p><p>&#x201c;I wish I&#x2019;d filmed this,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>They all stared at me.</p><p>&#x201c;You spoke!&#x201d; said Zoran. &#x201c;I was wondering if you knew how.&#x201d;</p><p>He was standing up now and the Babes walked around and around him with a roll of toilet paper, finishing off the process Flora had started on his head. That would have made a good film, too, but what I wanted to get&#x2014;what I was cross I&#x2019;d missed&#x2014;was that look between him and Flora, when she said she thought he was concussed and he said he looked like an Egyptian mummy.</p><p>She grinned and he melted.</p><p>That was when I knew we had nothing to fear from him.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The Film Diaries Of Bluebell Gadsby<br>SCENE TWO (transcript)<br>Mother and Daughter</p><p>DAY. THE GADSBY GARDEN.</p><p>The garden again, this time seen from above through the branches of the plane tree. MOTHER, barefoot but otherwise still dressed for work, is harvesting a lavender bush with a pair of rusty shears. When all the stalks are cut, she crouches to gather them into a waiting basket. She buries her face in her hands, and her shoulders relax as she inhales the scent of the flowers.</p><p>FLORA, also barefoot but in denim cutoffs, appears on the stone veranda at the top of the steps. Sound does not reach the camera, but it is obvious she is annoyed. Mother takes a step toward her, then stops to pick a stalk from her basket. She runs her index and thumb along the stem to strip it of its petals, which she crushes in her fist. She inhales again, then opens her hand and holds it out before her. The breeze scatters the petals. Mother squares her shoulders and turns toward her angry daughter.</p><p>Picture fades to black as CAMERAMAN (BLUE) turns camera off to climb back down to the ground.</p><p>Friday, August 26 (Afternoon)</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s weird,&#x201d; announced Flora, back in the kitchen.</p><p>&#x201c;He used to be a student of your father&#x2019;s. He&#x2019;s doing his doctorate in medieval literature, and he is a very nice young man.&#x201d; Mum had put her shoes back on, the Louboutin pumps with the red soles, which make her look like she is taller than Flora.</p><p>They couldn&#x2019;t see me where I was standing just outside the door. Mum looked tiny through the camera, but I could see her hand clenching and unclenching like it often does when she is fighting with Flora.</p><p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t even <i>need</i> a babysitter,&#x201d; shouted Flora. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sixteen! In some countries I&#x2019;d be married.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He is not a babysitter, he is an au pair. And you are not in <i>some countries.</i>&#x201d;</p><p>Flora looked stormy and didn&#x2019;t say anything. Mum reached out to touch her, but she stepped away. Mum sighed.</p><p>&#x201c;Now that the summer holidays are over, I am going to be traveling again, and with your father based in Warwick of course we need a babysitter. I left your brother and sisters with you for <i>one day</i>, Flora, and Jas ended up in hospital! Zoran can help you with homework when school starts again. He&#x2019;s rather brilliant, your father says. And it&#x2019;ll be fun for Twig and Jas, like having a big brother.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about Blue?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you mean, what about Blue?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What <i>about </i>me?&#x201d; I asked, and they both jumped.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop creeping<i> up </i>on<i> </i>people!<i>&#x201d; </i>said Flora. &#x201c;And stop <i>looking</i> at everyone through that stupid camera.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not on. And it&#x2019;s not stupid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You have homework, too,&#x201d; said Mum.</p><p>&#x201c;But I never need help with it,&#x201d; I pointed out.</p><p>&#x201c;Genius,&#x201d; muttered Flora, but Mum smiled at me.</p><p>&#x201c;Then he will just be a presence, my darling. A happy presence.&#x201d;</p><br>------------------------------<br><p>Once upon a time, about thirteen years ago, there were two little dots that grew into grains that grew into beans then babies, and they lived in the same warm water-filled sack, where they got fed through a long tube that went straight into their stomachs. The babies grew ears and mouths and fingers and toes, and they lived curled around each other. Doctors took photographs of them and people said that they were like two peas in a pod. Even before they were born, their parents called the babies Iris and Bluebell&#x2014;spring names for spring babies, they said. When it was time for them to leave the water everybody thought Bluebell would go first because she was biggest, but Iris beat her to it and shot headlong into the world so fast the midwife almost dropped her.</p><p>Grandma says that nothing could ever stop Iris rushing, not even me. It&#x2019;s how she was born, and nine years later it was how she died.</p><p>Iris has been dead for three years. Flora cried and cried when it happened, but I&#x2019;m not sure she ever thinks about her now. Not the way I do. Sometimes I dream that we&#x2019;re still sleeping curled around each other, and when I wake up my arms are reaching out for her. Once when Grandma was staying with us after the funeral, she said that sometimes people don&#x2019;t have to speak to each other to know what they are thinking, and that Iris and I had a special bond because we were twins. She said that when soldiers had limbs amputated in the war, they could still feel the arm or leg or foot that had been cut off and that this was what losing Iris was like for me. She said the memory of Iris would always be with me.</p><p>&#x201c;Like a soldier without a foot,&#x201d; Flora said. &#x201c;Blue will have to hop,&#x201d; she added, but Grandma said that wasn&#x2019;t what she meant at all.</p><p>At first when Iris died I used to see her everywhere. She felt so close I used to think our shadows had gotten mixed up. Sometimes now, if the sun is behind me when I am filming and I can see my own shadow I still pretend it&#x2019;s hers, but it&#x2019;s not the same, and Mum going on about big brothers and happy presences makes me want to scream, because I know that&#x2019;s not what she&#x2019;s really talking about, what she&#x2019;s really talking about is Iris and her unhappy absence.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The Film Diaries Of Bluebell Gadsby<br>SCENE THREE (transcript)<br>The Bank Holiday Family Picnic</p><p>DAY. SOME RANDOM PICNIC SPOT IN THE COUNTRY.</p><p>A tablecloth is spread beneath an oak tree. Bread, cheese, deli tubs of hummus, olives, and vine leaves. Tomatoes, ham, squashed strawberries in a Tupperware container. A half-empty bottle of white wine. FATHER lies on his back with a battered straw hat over his face. He wears crumpled chinos, a cotton shirt without a collar, and a tweed jacket with leather elbow patches. MOTHER lies beside him, leaning back on her elbows, watching JASMINE and TWIG build a den on the edge of the nearby woods. FLORA sits cross-legged with her back to them, listening to her iPod. White noise crackles around her. Father awakens, removes the hat from his face, and sits up. He is unshaven and has bags under his eyes.</p><p>FATHER</p><p>Dear child, must you make that ghastly noise?</p><p>Flora ignores him, nodding her head to the music. Father tiptoes over and removes earbuds from her ears.</p><p>FATHER</p><p>There is a reason they are called personal stereos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FLORA</p><p>(screeches and tries to grab back earbuds)</p><p><i>Nobody</i> calls them personal stereos!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>CAMERAMAN (BLUE) snorts.

I am using video footage for the images and some spoken words. There are not many spoken words in the video footage, because usually when people realize I am filming, they stop talking. Dad says that by the time I am grown up people will be so used to seeing me with a camera in my hand they won&#x2019;t be able to <i>stop </i>talking, and that I will make my fortune as a TV interviewer. But Dad says a lot of things. In the meantime, what I can&#x2019;t record on film, I write about on what he calls &#x201c;a contemporary echo of the old-fashioned notebook&#x201d;&#x2014;my laptop, recently inherited from Flora.</p><p>When I write, nobody can tell me to get lost. So I have lots of mini-films, for atmosphere, plus their transcripts on the laptop, as well as longer chapters for detail. It is a multimedia record. I have seen installations like this in the Tate Modern, where Dad takes me sometimes when he says home is just too much.</p><p>Just when things were getting interesting this afternoon, what with Flora screeching and Dad looking lost, Mum made me turn the camera off. I tried to explain&#x2014;again&#x2014;about the plan to record my life, and that I write about everything I don&#x2019;t film anyway, but Flora said she didn&#x2019;t care.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have to read your stupid diary,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re not filming me without any makeup.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Try to be nice,&#x201d; said Mum. &#x201c;A few more days and you&#x2019;ll be back at school.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank GOD!&#x201d; cried Flora.</p><p>Dad beamed and said, &#x201c;Do I detect...</p></p><h2>Mini Modern Classics The Crime Wave At Blandings</h2><p>Book by P.

The award is granted to "a photographer recognized for major achievement"; this may be an individual who has made a pioneering achievement in photography, who has had a decisive impact on one or more younger generations of photographers, or one who has implemented one or more internationally significant photographic projects.<br>The 2007 Hasselblad Award winner is Nan Goldin, easily one of the most significant photographers of our time. Adopting the direct aesthetics of snapshot photography, she has documented her own life and that of her friends and others on the margins of society for more than 30 years, offering frank depictions of drug abuse, cross-dressing and alternative sexualities. Her intimate photographs depict urban lives in New York and Europe in the 1970s, 80s and 90s, a period massively determined by HIV and AIDS. Her practice of photography as a memoir and as a defense against loss, and her use of the slide show to present her work, resonate increasingly in the work of photographers of recent generations.</p><p></p><h2>Multivariable Calculus</h2><p>Multivariable Calculus Textbook used for High School and College Students</p><p></p><h2>Making Love Just: Sexual Ethics for Perplexing Times</h2><p>Ethical reflection about sexuality is increasingly controversial, complex, and conflicted. After centuries of conflicting messages from the tradition, Christians are understandably confused about how exactly the good news pertains to sexuality. Using a series of provocative questions, Marvin Ellison, a pioneer in contemporary Christian rethinking of sexuality and sexual ethics, attempts to increase readers&#39; skills and confidence for engaging in ethical deliberation about sexuality. Redrawing the conventional, rule-based sexual morality, often rigidly and legalistically applied or broadly ignored, entails transcending fear and shame to redraw the sexual map, he argues. Ellison works to affirm a more relationally focused ethical framework, from which to deliberate about premarital and extramarital sex, marriage and divorce, homosexuality, contraception, abortion, spousal abuse, and sex-education. Students and all adults will welcome this book for enabling their personal clarity, approach to relationships, and mindful participation in respectful moral debate.</p><p>Marvin M. Ellison is Willard S. Bass Professor of Christian Ethics at Bangor Theological Seminary, Maine. He received his doctorate from Union Theological Seminary, New York City, and is an ordained Presbyterian minister. Principal author of the 1991 Presbyterian sexuality study, his works, among others, include Same-Sex Marriage? A Christian Ethical Analysis (2004), and, with co-editor Kelly Brown Douglas, Sexuality and the Sacred (2010)."Christians since early in their history have gotten sex wrong. The result is our present culture where sexual oppression and abuse abound. Fortunately, ethicists like Marvin M. Ellison envision a liberative sexual ethics rooted in the very principles of faith by carefully listening to the voices of those relegated to the margins. His latest book, <i>Making Love Just</i>, is required reading for all who wish to move the present discourse on sexual justice forward." --Miguel A.

Hunt, Women's Alliance for Theology, Ethics and Ritual (WATER)<br><br>"Faith leaders across traditions are calling for a new sexual ethic focused on personal relationships and social justice rather than particular sexual acts. That yearning for a sex-positive and justice-oriented framework is expressed strongly in the Religious Institute's own Religious Declaration on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing.

And until the breakthrough moment when a deal was secured, the men who steered their countries through the tense and often beguiling negotiations knew only that the futures of both nations were being questioned, and that the answer was uncertain.<br><br>Jefferson&#x2019;s Great Gamble is an extraordinary work that redefines one of the most important and overlooked events in American history. Charles A. Cerami reveals the untold thrusts and parries of the Louisiana Purchase, an event that was not just a land sale, but thirty months of high drama, blandishment, posturing and secret maneuvers by some of the most powerful and crafty men of their time. Utilizing original correspondence and firsthand accounts, Cerami paints a vivid and engrossing narrative enriched by the words of the men whose talents and weaknesses kept the negotiations alive during the most unsure moments.<br><br>When Thomas Jefferson took office as president of the United States in 1801, Louisiana was at the front of his mind. Jefferson knew that the future of the country hinged on its right to navigate the Mississippi River and have access to New Orleans. His hopes for maintaining this right were almost completely dashed when it was discovered that Napoleon had secretly forced Spain to give the Louisiana Territory to France, and that he had troops on the way to take possession of New Orleans. <br><br>Jefferson&#x2019;s only hope to stop the takeover lay in a great gamble: convincing Napoleon that the United States was willing to go to war over the port city. Jefferson knew that war might fracture the new country, which at the time had roughly one thousand men in its army. He was therefore faced with not only convincing Napoleon that the United States was ready to fight, but bluffing him into thinking that it could win that battle.<br><br>To execute his plan, Jefferson turned to his brilliant but troubled foreign-relations team. James Madison, the wily secretary of state, devised with Jefferson a disinformation strategy that was remarkable for its ingenuity and effectiveness. Robert Livingston, the American envoy to France, struggled to negotiate with French officials while being disdained and ignored by Jefferson and Madison, his political rivals. And as the final negotiations approached, James Monroe found himself sailing to Paris with the key to how the United States would execute the endgame.<br><br>Napoleon was bombarded by contradicting opinions from his two closest advisors. Fran�ois de Barb�-Marbois, the impeccably honest finance minister, pushed toward a sale to raise money for a war with England. Charles-Maurice de Tallyrand-P�rigord, Napoleon&#x2019;s witty and corrupt chief advisor, pushed him to hold on to the colony, a position he believed held long-term benefits for France, if not for Napoleon. <br><br>To read Jefferson&#x2019;s Great Gamble is to experience the tense days and nights leading to a decision that changed the face of the world. From the early American infighting to the heated French negotiations to the battle needed years later to secure the purchase, this new history is a story of dedicated men, each driven by love of country, who created an event that Robert Livingston called "the noblest work of our lives."</p><p>Charles A. Cerami is the author of eleven books, including Benjamin Banneker: Surveyor, Astronomer, Publisher, Patriot and A Marshall Plan for the 1990s. Cerami&#x2019;s articles have been published in The Atlantic Monthly, Playboy, New York Times, Foreign Policy, The Spectator (of London) and Swiss Review of World Affairs.In this bicentennial year of the Louisiana Purchase, it's hard to imagine a more lively, shrewd and vivid narrative of the tangled events leading to it than this book. Compared to Roger Kennedy's zigzagging, unfocused Mr. Jefferson's Lost Cause, Cerami's book is notable for its readability and clarity. When he occasionally strays from his subject, he stumbles badly and shouldn't be taken as an authority on history in other times; nor is his tale based on the most recent, pertinent scholarship and available documents. But about the geopolitical and diplomatic circumstances of the purchase, Cerami (A Marshall Plan for the 1990s, etc.) is a master. His greatest achievement is to bring all of the characters involved-not only the well-known figures like Napoleon, Jefferson and James Monroe, but also the less famous but equally significant ones such as Robert Livingston, Louis-Andr&#x201a; Pichon and Francois de Barb&#x201a;-Marbois-brilliantly to life. Cerami's book will not satisfy those looking to understand the larger significance of the sudden doubling of American territory-its implications for slavery, politics and the emergence of the U.S. as a continental and world power. But anyone wanting to read the story of a momentous turning point in American history, a story of diplomatic maneuvering and international politics, will be hard-pressed to find a better version than this.

Illustrated with line drawings and colour photographs, this informative book will be of interest to trampers, botanists and all who appreciate New Zealand&#39;s native flora.</p><p>This book was inspired by a ten-day survival experiment I undertook in the early 1970s. While researching, illustrating and writing it, I was often asked, &#39;Who would be interested?&#39; Remarkably, it has since gone into 15 printings with four different publishers and this in a country - New Zealand - with only 4 million inhabitants. It took three years to write, living in a cave for part of that time and written originally by hand. Like all my books, it was &#39;a labour of love&#39; and funded by the luxury of knowing how to live on nothing.

The discoveries in the two centuries that followed produced a revolution in artistic taste, affecting furniture, decoration and art in the whole civilized world. Raleigh Trevelyan&#39;s vivid narrative gives a striking personal impression of this ghostly city. He gives, too, an entertaining history of the slow unfinished striptease of time which gradually, tantalizingly, is revealing one of the greatest storehouses of treasures the world has seen, the source of much of our knowledge of daily life in the Roman world. The book is enriched by many magnificent colour plates - a mixture of nineteenth century paintings and prints, and present-day photographs of Pompeii.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Summer of My Amazing Luck</h2><p><p><b>'Toews's debut is a tart, affectionate look at welfare mothers...Toews is especially good on the "rollicking, happy, impoverished family" of the projects [and] scathing about the humiliations of poverty.' <i>New York Times</i></b></p><p>Lucy and her eight-month-old son live in a Winnipeg housing project filled with single mothers on the dole.

Although there are numerous, brief biographical sketches of individual scientists, the emphasis is chiefly and properly on their works. Topics include cosmology, stellar evolution, dark matter, quasars, the search for planets beyond the solar system, and the Voyager missions to the outer planets. The author is a professional astronomer turned skillful popularizer ( Supernova!: The Exploding Star of 1987 , LJ 10/1/89); accordingly, the scientific details are accurate, and the narrative is very readable. Occasionally, the historical sections are a bit misleading or unreliable as found in the discussion of Lord Kelvin's speculations on the age of the earth. Color photographs make this book visually spectacular. Recommended for public and college libraries.<br><i>- Jack W.

Sure, Jack has a wife and daughter at home, but this is just a little harmless flirting. Harmless, that is, until the blonde leans forward and says, "I poisoned your drink."</p><p>She tells Jack that unless she can keep someone within ten feet of her at all times, she'll die. And if he wants the antidote, he'll have to take her back to his hotel room and promise to stay by her side.</p><p>Jack thinks: psycho. But as the violent night wears on, and he encounters a relentless government assassin, a threatening voice on a cell phone, a deadly waitress, dirty cops, and shady cab drivers . . . </p><p>He begins to believe her... in Duane Swierczynski's thrilling <i>The Blonde. </i></p></p><p><b>Duane Swierczynski</b> is editor-in-chief of the <i>Philadelphia City Paper</i>. His novel, <i>The Wheelman</i>, was nominated for the Gumshoe Award and was optioned for film. He lives in Philadelphia.<p>Chapter 1I poisoned your drink.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You heard me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Um, I don&#x2019;t think I did.&#x201d;<br>The blonde lifted her cosmopolitan. &#x201c;Cheers.&#x201d;<br>But Jack didn&#x2019;t return the gesture. He kept a hand on his pint glass, which held the last two inches of the boilermaker he&#x2019;d been nursing for the past fifteen minutes.<br>&#x201c;Did you say you poisoned me?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Are you from Philadelphia?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What did you poison me with?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you be gracious and answer a girl&#x2019;s question?&#x201d;<br>Jack looked around the airport bar, which was done up like a Colonial-era public house, only with neon Coors Light signs. Instead of two more airline gates in the terminal, they&#x2019;d put in a square bar, surrounded by small tables jammed up against one another. Sit at the bar and you were treated to the view of the backs of the neon signs&#x2014;all black metal and tubing and dust&#x2014;a dented metal ice bin, red plastic speed pourers stuck in the tops of Herradura, Absolut Citron, Dewar&#x2019;s, and a plastic cocktail napkin dispenser with the logo jack &amp; coke: america&#x2019;s cocktail.<br>For commuters with a long layover, this was the only place to be. What, were you going to shop for plastic Liberty Bells and Rocky T-shirts all evening? The bar was packed.<br>But amazingly, no one else seemed to have heard her. Not the guy in the shark-colored suit standing next to the girl. Not the bartender, with a black vest and white sleeves rolled up to the elbow.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;About you being from Philadelphia?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;About you poisoning me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That again? For the record, yes, I poisoned you. I squeezed a tasteless, odorless liquid into your beer while you were busy staring at a brunette with a shapely ass and low-hanging breasts. The one on her cell, running her fingers through her hair.&#x201d;<br>Jack considered this. &#x201c;Okay. So where&#x2019;s the dropper?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dropper?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The one you used to squeeze poison into my drink. You had to use something.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;ll show you the dropper. But first you have to answer my question. Are you from Philadelphia?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What does it matter? You&#x2019;ve just poisoned me, and I&#x2019;m about to die in Philadelphia, so I guess, from this point on, I&#x2019;ll always be in Philadelphia.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not unless they ship your body home.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I meant my ghost. My ghost will always be in Philadelphia.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You believe in ghosts?&#x201d;<br>Jack smiled despite himself. This was delightfully weird. He&#x2019;d been delaying the inevitable&#x2014;a cab ride through a strange city to a bland corporate hotel room to catch what little sleep he could before his dreaded morning appointment.<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see the dropper.&#x201d;<br>The pretty blonde smiled in return. &#x201c;Not until you answer my question.&#x201d;<br>What was the harm? Granted, this was perhaps the strangest pickup line he&#x2019;d ever heard&#x2014;if that&#x2019;s what this was. For all he knew, it was the opening bit of an elaborate con game that targeted weary business travelers in airport bars. But that was fine. Jack knew if this conversation led to him taking out his wallet or revealing his Social Security number, he&#x2019;d stop it right there. No harm, no foul.<br>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not from Philadelphia.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Goody. I hate Philadelphia.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re from here, I take it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not from here, and yes, you can take it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s harsh.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s there to like?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The Liberty Bell?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Funny you should mention that. I was reading about it in the airline magazine. They have this back page where they tell the story of some famous national monument every month. Or however often the magazine is published. Anyway, the Liberty Bell cracked the very first time it was rung.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Back in 1776.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wrong. You should have read this story, my friend. Philly&#x2019;s been trading on a lie for, like, years. It wasn&#x2019;t rung in 1776. And worse yet, the bell? It was forged in England. You know, uh, the country we revolted against? Like, hello!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve just ruined Philadelphia for me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sweetheart, I haven&#x2019;t even started.&#x201d;<br>Jack smiled and finished the rest of the beer in his pint glass. There was no rush. He might as well order another&#x2014;minus the whiskey. He&#x2019;d already had two boilermakers, and it hadn&#x2019;t helped any. The drama of the past few months hung heavy in his mind. Might as well take it slow for a while, check out the people in the airport. The ones with a purpose in life. With a clear idea of where they were going, what they were doing.<br>The only thing waiting for Jack Eisley was a night in a bland hotel room and an appointment at eight o&#x2019;clock in the morning. He was in no hurry to get to either.<br>The blonde was looking at his hand. At first, Jack thought she was looking at his wedding ring. Which he was still wearing, for some dumb reason. But then he saw that she was focused on the glass in his hand.<br>&#x201c;You finished your drink,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re very observant. Still working on yours?&#x201d;<br>The girl smiled coyly. &#x201c;Why? You offering to buy me a drink? Even after I poisoned yours?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the least I can do. What are you having? A martini?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Never you mind that. Though I think I should tell you what to expect. Symptomwise.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;From the undetectable liquid poison.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Go ahead.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It works in stages. At first...&#x201d; She glanced at a silver watch on her wrist. &#x201c;Well, about an hour from now, you&#x2019;ll start to feel a knot in your stomach. Not too long after, I hope you&#x2019;ll be near a bathroom, because that&#x2019;s when the power vomiting starts.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sounds lovely.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Think about your worst hangover ever. You know, where you&#x2019;re sitting on the cold tile of your bathroom floor, begging God to show mercy on your poor alcoholic soul? Telling him how you&#x2019;ve seen the error of your ways, and you promise never, ever to touch the demon rum again? Well, that&#x2019;s a tenth of what you&#x2019;ll feel when this poison hits you. And in ten hours, you&#x2019;ll be dead.&#x201d;<br>Jack knew his mind was screwing with him&#x2014;of course he knew&#x2014;but damn if his stomach didn&#x2019;t tie itself into a little knot right at that moment. Ah, the power of suggestion. The power of suggestion of death.<br>Okay, this girl was fucking psycho. Last thing he needed was another one of those.<br>&#x201c;Um, can I ask why you did this to me?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure, you can ask.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But you won&#x2019;t tell.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Maybe later.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If I&#x2019;m even alive.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good point.&#x201d;<br>If this was a con game, she had strange ideas about running it. The bit about the poison would be enough to scare away most people. Which is not the reaction con artists want from their marks. They kind of have to be around for a scam to work.<br>So what was her game? Or was this a pickup?<br>&#x201c;Okay, you&#x2019;ve poisoned me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You catch on quick.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do you have an antidote?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sweet Jesus on the cross, I thought you&#x2019;d never ask. Yes, I do have an antidote.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Would you give me the antidote, if I asked nice?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But I can only give it to you somewhere quiet.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not here?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Where, then?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your hotel room.&#x201d;<br>Yep, that sealed it. This was a con game&#x2014;probably a bizarre variation of the old sweetheart scam. Take the woman to a hotel room, expect sex, get knocked on the head, wake up with your wallet gone, your kidney missing, your naked body in a tubful of stinky ice, whatever. Whichever way, you were fucked, all because you thought you were going to get a sloppy blow job in an airport hotel.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a kind offer,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but I think I&#x2019;ll take my chances with death.&#x201d;<br>Jack scooped up the loose bills on the bar&#x2014;a ten, two singles. He reached down and grabbed his overnight bag, which had been resting between his feet.<br>&#x201c;Good luck with that poison thing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thanks, Jack.&#x201d;<br>After a second, it hit him.<br>&#x201c;Wait. How did you know my name?&#x201d;<br>The woman turned her back to him and started looking through her purse. She removed a plastic eyedropper and placed it on top of the bar. She then lifted her head and swiveled around to look at him.<br>&#x201c;Weren&#x2019;t you leaving?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I said, how did you know my name?&#x201d;<br>Her fingers played with the eyedropper, spinning it on the surface of the bar. He leaned in closer.<br>&#x201c;You tell me or I&#x2019;ll bring airport security back here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be gone by then. And even if they did catch me, it&#x2019;s my word against yours about the poison. I won&#x2019;t know what on earth they&#x2019;re talking about.&#x201d; She pursed her lips and raised her eyebrows. &#x201c;Poison? An antidote?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d; He turned to walk away.<br>&#x201c;Oh, Jack?&#x201d;<br>He stopped, turned around.<br>&#x201c;Your name&#x2019;s on a tag attached to your bag.&#x201d;<br>He looked down at the carry-on in his hand.<br>&#x201c;Paranoid much?&#x201d;<br>He could feel it already&#x2014;the knot forming in his stomach. It wasn&#x2019;t sickness. It was anger.<br>After leaving the airport bar, Jack followed the signs to baggage claim. He didn&#x2019;t have luggage to pick up&#x2014;he made it a point to live out of one bag, no matter...</p></p><h2>The Birth of the Church: From Jesus to Constantine, AD 30-312 (Baker History of the Church)</h2><p>Christians today are becoming more and more interested in studying the roots of their faith and the development of the church.

The one he alights on is a spindly thorn, not tall enough for a nesting place, and a skeleton into the bargain, having been struck by lightning two years previously, but that isn't why the crow has chosen it. From his perch, he surveys the immediate terrain with a bright, cold, practised eye, on the lookout for small animals or birds, worms, insects, anything that moves. Or better still, carrion.He waits, unmoving, biding his time. Directly below him, out of sight, are caves hewn by prehistoric ancients out of the soft red sandstone of the hill. And below that, the village of Broughton Underhill, sitting comfortably as it has done since Saxon times alongside the shallow river which rises at the bubbling springs and the holy well of St Ethelfleda, and after that winds through the length of the village, at one point on its way broadening out to form the lake of the big house, Oaklands Park.Down there, the March afternoon is still, cold and quiet, so quiet its everyday sounds float up to the hilltop:the children's voices as they tumble noisily out of school, and the district nurse's bicycle bell as she makes sedate haste towards the imminent arrival of a new baby; the sound of the church clock striking four, and faintly, the jingle of the harness as old Harry Packer and his great draught horses, busy with the spring ploughing in the ten-acre field at the home farm, turn the rich red earth.Nothing stirs up there on the hillside. Nothing catches the crow's beady eye. After a while he gives up and, with a hoarse croak, spreads his wings again and glides on the thermals back down into the village.&nbsp;<br>The crow was there again, hunched on the washing-line post in the back garden of the rectory, as he had been intermittently for days, like a black Puritan parson, when Amy took the corn out for the hens. It was a task she hated. Senseless creatures they were, screeching like flustered, hysterical old women. The slightest thing agitated them but they had to be tolerated, providing as they did much needed eggs and the occasional boiling fowl.The hairs on the back of her neck rose when she saw the big bird and she clapped her hands to frighten it away, but only succeeded in provoking the silly hens to further squawks; with the same hard, unblinking stare the crow went on regarding her efforts to scatter corn from her basket as far as she could, in order to keep the hens from her feet. She would have crossed herself if she'd been a Catholic, or if she hadn't thought her father might be watching out of his study window.Florrie said crows were bad luck, they brought infection, they were omens of discord, and even death,and after the last years no one wanted any more of any of these, thank you very much. Well, yes, Amy thought - but I for one don't intend to go on being miserable now that the beastly war with the Germans is over, now that I've turned eighteen and might begin to make up for what I've missed while it was on, stuck here in this dreary backwater. All very well for Florrie to sniff. But I don't ask for much, really... dresses that I haven't had to make over myself; some real jewellery, not just that childish string of corals and the pearl ring that was Mama's; pretty shoes, she thought longingly, scuffing the toe of one hated, serviceable lace-up into the scratched, dusty wasteland the fowls had made of the backyard; some soft, embroidered underwear, scent, parties and dances. And later, a nice house, and pretty little babies... And, of course, a husband. She shivered deliciously at the frisson that ran down her spine.One of the brave, handsome men returned from the front, he will have to be. One of the survivors, young and eligible. There's going to be a scramble for those who are left. Of course, it's ridiculous to think of me, Aim�e Wentworth, having the ghost of a chance among all those girls (although some of them are practically old maids now, having waited all these years!); those girls who are rich, ready to grab, not as choosy as they had been before the war.But I, too, have assets...and I've seen how young men look at me.Amy forgot the crow, excitement making her pulses race faster as she gazed, unseeing, at the gloomy old trees crowded behind the house and nourished thesenot altogether unattainable dreams with a mental list of her considerable attractions. True, she had no money, and she wasn't at all clever, like Nella or Marianne - but what man wanted a clever wife? Just look how Nella had thrown her chances away - that certainly hadn't been clever. Amy herself had other assets - sparkling hazel eyes and the rich, waving red hair she had inherited from her mother, a well-curved little figure; she knew perfectly well how appealing her glowing looks were, and would be even more so if she had the right clothes to show them off. She had a good temper, an ability to laugh often, naturally pretty manners, and knew how to behave: she hadn't wasted her time during the hours spent with her honorary aunt, Lady Sybil, and Eunice, at Oaklands Park, but had listened and learnt, even while they were only knitting those everlasting scarves and socks for the Tommies on the front line, or boring old squares to be made up into blankets for Belgian refugees from scraps of leftover wool.And by no means least, as their grandmother never let them forget, there were the family connections which still meant a great deal: their mother had after all been a cousin of Lady Sybil's , a Greville like her, and before her marriage to Papa, had come out herself. Though much good it had done her, thought Amy, who had scarcely known her mother and had never been allowed near enough her father to really know him, either.But yes, my turn will come, and I <i>won't</i> let it slip from my fingers, she vowed, her chin taking on its stubborn tilt, already aware that luck was what you made it. Aunt Sybil will have time and opportunity for social life again, once the last convalescent soldier has gone away, the hospitalis closed and Oaklands restored to what it was before the war. There'll be house parties and tennis parties again and Eunice will want me and Nella to be invited, especially now that Grev won't be there. Grev, and...and...the others. But don't think of that.Amy never allowed herself to be despondent for long. She wholeheartedly agreed with Florrie: if you don't look after yourself, nobody else will. And anyway, if the worst came to the worst, she thought defiantly, tossing her red curls, she had the means in her power to <i>make</i> what she wanted happen.But the thought of this was a little bit too daring, even for Amy, and she swished round to go indoors, clapping her hands and whirling the empty basket at the black harbinger of doom still eyeing her from the washing post, just to show she wasn't to be intimidated by a mere crow, but he didn't move. Until she turned away; then, with a rusty caw that sounded suspiciously like a cackling laugh, he flew away to busy himself with the mice in the church belfry.&nbsp;<br>The afternoon sun had grown lower in the sky when, sated with mice and on his way back to his roost, the black bird paused to rest on a bedroom window sill of the Greville Arms, but no one noticed; there were things of more importance going on in the room. The publican's firstborn, nine-pound baby had not long ago uttered his first cry in the world - or rather, a lusty shout, thought his exhausted but exultant mother, smiling... Oh, yes, his father's son all right, she thought fondly. Another Sam Noakes. Strong as an ox, a lot of noise, but soft as butter. She and her baby gazed at each other and Mattie foundin this new little face total recognition, and fell in love all over again.They hadn't been married when her Sam had enlisted with the Worcesters right at the beginning of the war. Couldn't keep him back, though he was mithered about leaving his widowed father, bad as he was with rheumatism. But Walter Noakes, a veteran of the war with the Boers, had been as eager for him to go as Sam himself. 'What? Let the bloody Kaiser stamp all over us? Not likely! You get out there, son, and wipe the floor with them Germans! You'll be home by Christmas, see if you won't.'Some hopes! Four years later, they were still fighting, all those men of the village who'd joined up together and seen action in all the worst of the war - at places with unpronounceable names, that the Tommies called Wipers, Pop, Armenteers... Sam, lucky Sam, big flaxen-haired Sam with his muscles honed from all that helping his uncle in the smithy next door in his spare time, had miraculously gone through it all with only minor wounds and a dose of trench fever, until the Blighty one at Neuve Eglise. Shrapnel tearing through the flesh of his leg, that was, a bad enough wound to get him a ticket home and a brief sick leave, but not bad enough to prevent him being sent back to the front afterwards, as the daily lists of those lost began to fill page after page after page in the newspapers.Just two weeks they'd had together, during that last home leave. She, fearful, he persuasive: 'Come on, girl, I'll take care of you - you'll be all right. Say yes.''All right,' she'd replied. He hadn't said he might never come back, he didn't need to, with nearly everyone they knew losing sons, fathers, brothers, cousins, and thenews from the front blacker than ever.But in spite of his promises, she'd found herself pregnant after he was sent back to the front. Heads were shaken, of course they were, but Broughton had never been overjudgemental about the 'mishaps' that happened from time to time in their village; they were two healthy young folk, after all, and Sam was a hero, wounded and going back to the front and all. She'd had to leave her job up at the Big House, but she would have done that anyway to come to live at the pub and help out, to look after Sam's father and wait for the baby. A few months later, the miraculous happened: the tide was turned against the Germans and they were forced to retreat, the Armistice was signed and Sam was safe and one of the first to be sent home, just in time to put a ring on her finger before their baby should be born.Sometimes, Mattie could scarcely believe her good fortune. That she, Mattie O'Hara as was, one of the seven O'Haras brought up in the two-bedroomed cottage at the end of Water End Lane, had not been left alone with a child to bring up, and that her man had come home whole in his body and right in his mind, not like some. And that, God willing, she would never know poverty again now, it being in the nature of things that innkeepers, while never becoming rich, maybe, were never short of business. And more than that: in time, the smithy next door would come to Sam, his Uncle Ted being childless.The afternoon sun poured in and the baby's greedy little mouth found her breast and latched on to it, his eyes closed in total abandonment as he began his first attempts to suck. Mattie leant back and was content.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The district nurse felt the shadow of the crow across the window as she came back into the room. She wasn't superstitious, but this had been a good birth, easy for a first one considering the baby's size, and she was taking no chances. She put down her can of hot water, dropped the armful of clean sheets on the end of the bed and marched to the window, but she was too late, the black bird had already gone, flying home on strongly beating wings towards Oaklands Park.For a while, he seems to pause over the small lake in the grounds, turned to sheet gold by the dying sun. His glance appears to rest meditatively for an instant on the old, broken-down boathouse and the rotten posts of the old jetty still standing above the water, and the sombre conifers surrounding the lake, and the red cliff of the Hill rising above. He wasn't alive at the time of the happenings there, but perhaps some atavistic memory stirs in him. Neglected, like everything during the last few years and never very sturdy, the boathouse itself now looks ready to follow the jetty into the lake.&nbsp;<br>Warrant Officer Jack Shawcross, 1st Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Yorkshire Regiment, lay on the bed that had been wheeled out on to the terrace, the blankets rearranged around him by Nurse Wentworth before she went off duty. He watched the colony of birds noisily settling on their nests in the tall, leafless elms opposite, their branches a black tracery against the cold sunset. Rooks or crows, he could never be sure which birds they were, though he had plenty of time to observe them, with nothing much else to do but look into the blank void thatwas his future. Wondering whether it was possible to be so broken, and yet find the possibility of going on.At night, when the roaring dreams and sweats came, and the agony in his non-existent legs began, he tried not to think about golden-haired Emily, the girl he'd been engaged to, and the last letter she'd sent him.BROKEN MUSIC.

For thirty years, faithful readers have followed Price to the vivid worlds of her Georgia trilogy, her Florida trilogy, her Savannah quartet, and her many other novels. Her stories of local people and the homes where their stories unfold easily become familiar, loved places. <p>"That a house, a locale, is central to all my novels, makes good sense," Ms. Price believes. "I am and have always been almost overly sensitive to the house, the place in which I live. Finding St. Simons Island changed my very life-its tempo, its basic simple quality, even my own capacity for lasting relationships. </p><p>Here, Eugenia shares with her worldwide reading public some of what life was like during the first years in which she and her best friend and fellow writer, Joyce Blackburn, were becoming Islanders. "These short pieces," she says, "include my observations day by day of what it was like at last to be at home on St. Simons. We were learning how to be neighbors, after so many years of complex life in the huge northern city of Chicago; learning how to care deeply for people with whom, at first glace, we had little in common. We were understanding what it really meant to come home." </p><p>Eugenia Price, called by many St. Simons' own "beloved invader," here shows readers those early years as they were being lived. Her cherished ST. SIMONS MEMOIR was written from memory and notes in old desk calendars, but AT HOME ON ST. SIMONS illuminates some of the experiences which most shaped and changed Eugenia-written as they occured. </p><p>In the opening chapter, Ms. Price attempts to explain-almost as though to herself-why, in the face of such drastic change on the small, once provincial island on the Georgia coast, she is still at home on St. Simons. Her emotional connection to the island and her sense of place absorb local St. Simons readers as well as those who have never seen the island firsthand. </p><p>Millions have read Eugenia Price's books, which have been translated into more that fifteen languages. The formative, poignant moments related in AT HOME ON ST. SIMONS bring a universal appeal to this singular volume that retraces the beginning of Price's real-life love for St. Simons Island.</p></p><p>Eugenia Price was the author of numerous best-selling books.

He is the New York Times bestselling author of twenty-eight thriller and nonfiction titles, including The Intruders, The Minotaur, Under Siege, The Red Horseman, and The Cannibal Queen. A combat pilot in the Vietnam War, Coonts&#x2019;s technical knowledge of aviation and warfare has contributed to the enormous popularity of his novels. The author currently divides his time between his home in Colorado and a farm in West Virginia, where he does much of his writing.Rear Admiral Jake Grafton, aviator-hero of Coonts's Under Siege (1990), etc., now saves the world from potential Armageddon- -and gets to meet Boris Yeltsin and Saddam Hussein in the bargain. The nearly nonstop action begins when an Israeli spy gives Jake's assistant Toad Tarkington a photo that leads Jake and Toad to suspect a CIA cabal at work in numerous evil deeds, including the murder of publishing magnate Nigel Keren (read: Robert Maxwell) by way of ``binary'' poison--poison that, because of the duo's sleuthing, may next be used on them. But despite the threat, Jake and Toad soldier on with their next assignment: to monitor the dismantling of Soviet nuclear missiles. The pair's sojourn in Russia allows Coonts to indulge in his usual soapboxing (``In case you haven't noticed,'' says Jake, ``Russia is a third-world shithole'') even as Jake and Toad meet with beetle-browed generals and try to avoid being poisoned by the CIA cabal. Meanwhile, an anti-Yeltsin KGB faction blows up a Russian nuclear-weapons site, causing a meltdown that may kill a million (```Another million,' Jake Grafton roared savagely. `God in heaven, when will it ever stop?'''). As Russia erupts in panic, Jake learns that the meltdown covered up the theft from the site of several warheads that were then sold to Saddam Hussein. After Jake confers with Yeltsin, the admiral and Toad's pilot-wife take to the skies to bomb the reactor's remaining missiles, shooting down renegade KGB jets in the process. Jake then exposes the CIA cabal and retrieves the stolen warheads through a raid on Iraq--where both the outlaw KGB leader and Saddam himself make a big mistake by getting in Jake's way. Coonts's plots are getting as overcomplicated as Tom Clancy's, but his flying-and-fighting scenes are as exciting as ever. Chalk up another red, white, and blue ace for the author and his jet- jockeys. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Murphy Lectures)</h2><p>Korean painters participated in two major cultural trends of the late Choson period in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries: inquiry into things Korean and investigation of things Western. Departing from Chinese sources long considered authoritative, they developed the distinctly Korean mode known as &#x201c;true-view&#x201d; landscape painting for depicting the scenery of their own country. Rooted in the documentary painting of the early Choson period and displaying special techniques developed to describe distinctive features of Korea&#x2019;s topography, true-view paintings portray the most exemplary and ideal landscapes of Korea, such as those of Mount Kumgang (Diamond Mountain). <br><br>The same painters also drew on Western painting methods, which they learned from descriptions of Western paintings seen and recorded by Korean emissaries to Beijing as well as from actual paintings brought back. This knowledge inspired them to produce not only landscapes but also portraits, images of animals and other paintings based on firsthand observation of nature. Both trends, looking inward to Korea and outward to the West, represented Korean aspiration for something new &#x2015; for &#x201c;modernity.&#x201d; Deftly weaving these two strands together as the unifying theme of Searching for Modernity, Yi Song-mi expands on her pioneering work on true-view landscape painting to reveal even more of the depth and complexity of this mature and fully Korean form of artistic expression.</p><p><b>Yi Song-mi </b>is professor emerita of art history at the Academy of Korean Studies in Songnam, near Seoul.

The biography covers carefully and accurately the various facets of the comedian's amazingly long career, but Marx ( My Life With Groucho ) is obviously far more interested in revealing sordid details of Hope's compulsive philandering than any other aspect of his 90 years. The author breaks new ground in sleaziness with hearsay anecdotes about Hope's alleged rigging of a beauty contest in return for the winner's sexual favors, his supposed stranding of an actress on a remote Pacific isle because she rebuffed his advances, unsubstantiated stories of Hope and Bing Crosby exchanging lovers, and one tale that combines oral sex with a case of poison ivy.

Wenner, Mikal Gilmore, Kurt Loder, and Cott himself. Other highlights include Nat Hentoff's legendary 1966 <em>Playboy</em> interview with the singer; Studs Terkel's 1963 radio interview on Chicago's WFMT; the interview Dylan gave to screenwriter Jay Cocks when Cocks was a Kenyon College student in 1964; a 1965 interview with director Nora Ephron; and an interview that Sam Shepard turned into a one-act play for <em>Esquire</em> in 1987. Each piece portrays Bob Dylan as an interview subject who, as Cott writes in his introduction, is "at once obviously reluctant, self-protecting, and self-concealing but equally often a stunningly direct, heartfelt, epiphanic, poetic, and, most important, playful expositor of his munificent and inspiring thought-dreams."</p></p><p><strong>Jonathan Cott </strong>is the author of sixteen books including DYLAN (a biography), CONVERSATIONS WITH GLENN GOULD, STOCKHAUSEN: CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COMPOSER, and BACK TO A SHADOW IN THE NIGHT: MUSIC WRITINGS AND INTERVIEWS - 1968-2001 and co-editor of THE BALLAD OF JOHN AND YOKO.

(This may have been a slow but not totally calculated decision: As he told People magazine in 1975, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t consciously pursue the Bob Dylan myth. It was given to me by God.

Use to do all kinds of stuff like that.&#x201d; As he told the New York Herald Tribune in 1965, &#x201c;My past is so complicated you wouldn&#x2019;t believe it, man.&#x201d;<br> <br>His life story changed as he proceeded onward in his journey, as, remarkably, did his physiognomy and everyday appearance. Like the Greek sea deity Proteus, who in order to elude his pursuers continually shape-shifted from dragon to lion to fire to flood&#x2014;uttering prophecies along the way&#x2014;Bob Dylan, in his early days, had, according to the folksinger Eric von Schmidt, &#x201c;the most incredible way of changing shape, changing size, changing looks. The whole time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he wore the same thing, his blue jeans and cap. And sometimes he would look big and muscular, and the next day he&#x2019;d look like a little gnome, and one day he&#x2019;d be kind of handsome and virile, and the following day he&#x2019;d look like a thirteen-year-old child. It was really strange.&#x201d; (One thinks of the advice once given by the ancient Greek elegiac poet Theognis: &#x201c;Present a different aspect of yourself to each of your friends&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Follow the example of the octopus with its many coils which assumes the appearance of the stone to which it is going to cling. Attach yourself to one on one day and, another day, change color. Cleverness is more valuable than inflexibility.&#x201d;)<br> <br>You would also never know what his voice was going to sound like. One of the other fascinating, if obvious, things about Bob Dylan&#x2019;s chameleonic personality was the way the timbre of his voice would change from one record or period of his life to another&#x2014;as if his voice, too, couldn&#x2019;t stand having just one unvarying sound. When he first arrived in New York City, he was singing like a hillbilly, &#x201c;like a dog with his leg caught in barbed wire,&#x201d; as someone remarked at the time. And as years went by, Dylan&#x2019;s voice would veer from, in his words, &#x201c;that thin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wild mercury sound&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. metallic and bright gold&#x201d; of Blonde on Blonde (1966) to the insouciant country sound, which Dylan attributes to his having stopped smoking cigarettes, of Nashville Skyline (1969) to the openheartedness, gentleness, vulnerability, and anger of Blood on the Tracks (1975) to the haunting timbral admixture of sandpaper and sherry of Time Out of Mind (1997).<br> <br>The French poet Arthur Rimbaud&#x2019;s &#x201c;I is another&#x201d; became Dylan&#x2019;s self-defining (selves-defining) modus vivendi. Reading a newspaper account of himself, he once remarked, &#x201c;God, I&#x2019;m glad I&#x2019;m not me.&#x201d; When asked by a reporter the reason for his wearing a wig and a fake beard at a 2003 Newport Folk Festival concert, Dylan replied, &#x201c;Is that me who you saw up there?&#x201d; In a 1977 interview I conducted with him about his film Renaldo and Clara, Dylan explained to me, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s Renaldo, there&#x2019;s a guy in whiteface singing on the stage, and then there&#x2019;s Ronnie Hawkins playing Bob Dylan. Bob Dylan is listed in the credits as playing Renaldo, yet Ronnie Hawkins is listed as playing Bob Dylan.&#x201d; &#x201c;So Bob Dylan,&#x201d; I surmised, &#x201c;may or may not be in the film.&#x201d; &#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d; &#x201c;But Bob Dylan made the film.&#x201d; &#x201c;Bob Dylan didn&#x2019;t make it,&#x201d; he told me. &#x201c;I made it.&#x201d;<br> <br>He even explored and confessed to the more particulated (some might say self-splitting) nature of his being. &#x201c;Have you ever felt like a couple?&#x201d; the playwright and actor Sam Shepard once asked him. &#x201c;A couple?&#x201d; Dylan responded. &#x201c;You mean two? Yeah. All the time. Sometimes I feel like ten couples.&#x201d; And as he informed Newsweek&#x2019;s David Gates: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m tangible to myself. I mean, I think one thing today and I think another thing tomorrow. I change during the course of a day. I wake and I&#x2019;m one person, and when I go to sleep I know for certain I&#x2019;m somebody else. I don&#x2019;t know who I am most of the time. It doesn&#x2019;t even matter to me.&#x201d; (One thinks of the Buddhist notion that the ego isn&#x2019;t an entity but rather a process in time, as well as of Virginia Woolf&#x2019;s comment in Orlando that &#x201c;a biography is considered complete if it merely accounts for six or seven selves, whereas a person may well have as many thousand.&#x201d;)<br> <br>Throughout his career he has played off his role of &#x201c;Bob Dylan&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;I have my Bob Dylan mask on, I&#x2019;m masquerading,&#x201d; he told a Halloween concert audience in 1964&#x2014;against the silent center of his inner life. At a 1986 press conference he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m only Bob Dylan when I have to be.&#x201d; When asked who he was the rest of the time, he replied, &#x201c;Myself.&#x201d; In an interview with Clinton Heylin, Cesar Diaz, who spent five years working with Dylan as a guitar tech in almost daily proximity to him, said: &#x201c;I&#x2019;d been searching the same guy for years and years. I&#x2019;d get a glimpse of the guy once in a while&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He actually put his cards down a couple of times&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You would have to be with him, and be there at that right moment when he just opens up and says, &#x2018;Okay, I&#x2019;m just Bob and Bob has no last name.&#x2019; &#x201d; And when the mask comes off, as it does in his astonishing song &#x201c;Abandoned Love,&#x201d; his life and his world become transparent both to himself and to us:<br> <br>Everybody&#x2019;s wearing a disguise<br> <br>To hide what they&#x2019;ve got left behind their eyes<br> <br>But me, I can&#x2019;t cover what I am<br> <br>Wherever the children go I&#x2019;ll follow them.<br> <br>The legendary American pianist William Kapell, who died at the age of thirty-one in a 1953 plane crash, once wrote to a friend: &#x201c;The only moments I have when I play that are worth anything to me are when I can blissfully ignore the people I am supposed to be entertaining. No me; no silly public to amuse; only the heart and the soul, the world, the birds, storms, dreams, sadness, heavenly serenity. Then I am an artist worthy of the name&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Until it happens, or if it doesn&#x2019;t happen, I am miserable.&#x201d;<br> <br>Like Kapell, Bob Dylan is one of a number of creative artists who has throughout his life been chary of courting and rewarding his fans&#x2019; sometimes fanatical adulation. As the psychologist Jeffrey Satinover presciently wrote: &#x201c;Once the star is established, his fans will tear him to pieces should ever he fail to carry for them the projected childhood Self. A recent example from pop culture is the fans&#x2019; vituperative reaction to Bob Dylan&#x2019;s unexpected changes of style. Once a narcissistic complementation has been set up between any leader and his following, he is as bound as they. The rigidity of the relationship and the strength of the forces maintaining the status quo stem from the mutual common individual fear of fragmentation.&#x201d; His sense of other people&#x2019;s &#x201c;wanting my soul,&#x201d; as he confessed to Nat Hentoff, has often encouraged Dylan to disappear into himself and to become a stranger to others (and perhaps sometimes to himself as well).<br> <br>&#x201c;A stranger in a strange land,&#x201d; Bob Dylan calls himself in his song &#x201c;You Changed My Life.&#x201d; (An &#x201c;equivocal stranger,&#x201d; like Herman Melville&#x2019;s Confidence Man.) Elusive, oblique, mercurial, and always in motion, he has resisted in both his life and his work being categorized, encapsulated, finalized, conventionalized, canonized, and deified. &#x201c;Greed and lust I can understand,&#x201d; he once said, &#x201c;but I can&#x2019;t understand the values of definition and confinement. Definition destroys.&#x201d; He has therefore always been wary of being entrapped in the amber of interviewers&#x2019; id�es fixes or projected fantasies about himself, of their attempt to pry into and unravel his private life, to murder and to dissect his creative processes.<br> <br>In Inter Views, a fascinating book of conversations with Laura Pozzo, the imaginal psychologist James Hillman expresses his own distrust of the interview form in terms that Bob Dylan might well assent to: &#x201c;Interviews belong to an ego genre: one ego asking another ego. So one thinks one has to proceed in terms of &#x2018;I answer a question&#x2019; and &#x2018;stick to the topic,&#x2019; &#x2018;the given subject,&#x2019; and one tries to say it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you know, nicely, tightly, rationally. &#x2018;Directed thinking&#x2019; it&#x2019;s called in psychiatry. All ego. Now, the kind of psychology that I want to do is not addressed to the ego. It is to evoke imagination, it&#x2019;s to be extremely complex, it&#x2019;s to talk with emotion and from emotion and to emotion; so how can you, in an interview, bring in that complexity? How can you speak to the whole psyche at the same time?&#x201d;<br> <br>How does one, therefore, go about interviewing someone as mutable and multiple as Bob Dylan&#x2014;a person who once sang, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ask me nothin&#x2019; about nothin&#x2019;/I might just tell you the truth&#x201d; (&#x201c;Outlaw Blues&#x201d;), someone who doesn&#x2019;t give himself (or his self) up lightly?<br> <br>Mikal Gilmore, who conducted five interviews with Dylan, comments: &#x201c;His reputation precedes him, more than anybody I&#x2019;ve ever encountered. And like so many others, I&#x2019;ve seen varying documentations of what that reputation is based on. In his appearance in Don&#x2019;t Look Back, he has a conversation with a young man who&#x2019;s referred to as a science student, and he asks Dylan what&#x2019;s his attitude when he first meets somebody, and Dylan says, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t like them.&#x2019; And in that and other documentations both in film and on the page you expect someone who can be pretty sharp and acerbic. But in my initial meeting with him I was relieved early on in our conversation. There were moments when some of that pride and flair could rise up. But on that occasion he was generous and relaxed.<br> <br>&#x201c;The first time I talked to him was between the release of Infidels and Biograph when I was working at the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner. I was initially supposed to see him at his house out in Malibu, but he ended up just coming over to my apartment in West Hollywood. It was a nervous-making prospect having him visit me at my place. I anticipated an hour&#x2019;s length conversation but he stayed for four or five hours, just sitting on my sofa. We had a couple of beers, and I found him amazingly gracious and relaxed, maybe because it was the change of environment that didn&#x2019;t focus on his world so much&#x2014;it may be that he might have been more guarded if someone came to his home. I talked to him several times after that over the years, and that was pretty much my experience except for one occasion when we got into an argument about something, but even then, at the end of that moment, he lapsed back into being the gracious host.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always felt that there are parts of himself that he doesn&#x2019;t give up easily, if at all, in an interview. I don&#x2019;t think he gives it up even in Chronicles, which is an autobiography of the mind. There are parts of his experience and frame of mind that he doesn&#x2019;t go into readily&#x2014;he may eventually, though I don&#x2019;t think he has yet. But it must not be easy facing questions asking you to analyze yourself and your work and how you&#x2019;ve measured up in cultural expectations, because not only can that be so grueling personally, but it must take a toll on one&#x2019;s will to be an artist.&#x201d;<br> <br>Robert Hilburn, who has interviewed Dylan ten times for The Los Angeles Times, remarks: &#x201c;Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan were the two people I was most nervous about ever meeting because they were such heroes of mine. And I had seen Don&#x2019;t Look Back and read about how he was difficult and mysterious and manipulative in interviews. So you bring a nervousness to an interview with him, thinking, My goodness, if I say the wrong thing we&#x2019;re not going to connect. So I think the writer brings a lot of preconceptions to it that sometimes make it difficult to have a conversation with him.<br> <br>&#x201c;In his mind, he&#x2019;s seen himself misused in the press, with people misunderstanding or trying to label and categorize him, so that he&#x2019;s a little bit suspicious of the whole interview and media process. And if you come to him with a lot of nervousness, you can almost freeze as an interviewer. You really want to ask certain questions and your focus is on that. But Dylan will often reject those questions. And you have to step back and say, Okay, what does he want to talk about, and then let him find a comfort zone or a topic he&#x2019;s happy with, and then keep going down that path. But as an interviewer you have to make that kind of transition. There&#x2019;s a generosity and straightforwardness about him, and a hidden intelligence that you don&#x2019;t often notice when you&#x2019;re talking to him. You have to get back to the tape and listen to it when the interview is done to discover it because your nervousness has hidden it from you when you were speaking to him.<br> <br>&#x201c;He once told me that from his point of view the hard thing was that people often asked him questions he hadn&#x2019;t ever thought about and wanted an answer right then. And he didn&#x2019;t want to give a shallow reply, so sometimes he&#x2019;d be hesitant or pause, and if he saw that there was no way to do it, he&#x2019;d just want to move on to something else. A lot of times interviewers try to keep him on that question, and that&#x2019;s why he sometimes starts playing games just to try to get past that.<br> <br>&#x201c;He also once told me that he doesn&#x2019;t like interviews because he often didn&#x2019;t know what he should say until he was driving away. So I mentioned to him that he could call me at the paper the next day if he thought of something. And so he did call&#x2014;it was a Saturday&#x2014;and he had a couple of things he had written down, like Johnny Carson jokes, and one of them was: &#x2018;The country is so confused these days they don&#x2019;t know whether to follow the president or the Green Bay Packers.&#x2019; So he&#x2019;d thought about those lines and called back to say them for my article.<br> <br>&#x201c;If he can talk about things he feels comfortable about, you don&#x2019;t need to pull or prod him, he&#x2019;ll just start talking. You simply have to relax and let him take the reins a bit. The Don&#x2019;t Look Back thing really does hang over him, but that&#x2019;s not the way he always is. Sometimes you just want to give him a hug when he does feel comfortable and starts talking in a meaningful way. And I really treasure those moments and his warmth a lot.&#x201d;<br> <br>Those of us fortunate enough to have been invited to interview Bob Dylan were usually forewarned to expect a hyperequivocal, trickster-like character, someone ineluctably prone to caustic put-ons and put-downs. In fact, he is&#x2014;as most of the interviews in this collection make clear&#x2014;at once obviously reluctant, self-pr...</p><h2>A hell of a woman</h2><p>Young, beautiful, and fearfully abused, Mona was the kind of girl even a hard man like Dillon couldn&#39;t bring himself to use.

He began writing fiction at a very young age, selling his first story to <i>True Detective</i> when he was only fourteen. Thompson eventually wrote twenty-nine novels, all but three of which were published as paperback originals. Thompson also wrote two screenplays (for the Stanley Kubrick films &#x201c;The Killing&#x201d; and &#x201c;Paths of Glory&#x201d;). An outstanding crime writer, the world of his fiction is rife with violence and corruption. In examining the underbelly of human experience and American society in particular, Thompson&#x2019;s work at its best is both philosophical and experimental. Several of his novels have been filmed by American and French directors, resulting in classic noir including <b>The Killer Inside Me</b> (1952), <b>After Dark My Sweet</b> (1955), and <b>The Grifters</b> (1963).</p><h2>The Contradictions of Pension Fund Capitalism (LERA Research Volume)</h2><p><p>It is often hoped and assumed that union stewardship of pension investments will produce tangible and enduring benefits for workers and their communities while minimizing the negative effects of what are now global and intensely competitive capital markets.

Many of the monologues herein are by playwrights of considerable reputation, such as Nilo Cruz, Stephen Adly Guirgis, Lynn Nottage, Lisa Loomer, and Michael Weller. Others are by future stars, such as Stephanie Fleischmann, Ruben Carbajal, Allison Moore, Jeanmarie Williams, Jonathan Rand, and Sheila Callaghan. Most are monologues by characters under forty, although there are a few, from plays such as Ears on a Beatle, which may be useful to older actors. I made a conscientious effort this year to find some great monologues that will be of particular interest to teen actors, such as the ones from Chicken Bones for the Teenage Soup, Eloise &amp; Ray, The Gifted Program, and The Moonlight Room.

By learning how to develop these faculties, we can help to rid ourselves of the loneliness and insecurity we feel.

For six straight months after Peterson's arrest, Dalton was the defense's only full-time investigative attorney on the case. During that time, he lived in Modesto and investigated every element of the case, interviewing scores of witnesses, reviewing more than 35,000 pages of police documents, and meeting almost daily with Scott Peterson in jail.What he has uncovered will astound even the most informed observers of the Laci Peterson murder case and challenge the most deeply held beliefs about what really happened to Laci Peterson on Christmas Eve, 2002.This is the first book to go inside the Peterson defense team, and the only book to detail all the evidence that the jury did not hear -- evidence that might have led to Scott Peterson's acquittal, and that will surely play a crucial part in his pending appeals.Among the revelations in Presumed Guilty:<ul> Reports from numerous witnesses who saw Laci Peterson alive and well the morning of December 24, after the police claim Scott Peterson had already killed her; none of them testified at trial The story of another woman, eight months pregnant, who was harassed by two men the morning of December 24 only five blocks from the Peterson home The burglary that reportedly occurred directly across the street from the Peterson home on the morning of December 24, and the confessed burglars' questionable claims that the burglary happened days later Previously unreported details of the autopsy reports on Laci Peterson and her son, which cast strong doubts on key elements of the prosecution's case The disappearances of six pregnant women, in addition to Laci, reported missing and presumed dead within eighty miles of Modesto between 1999 and 2002Compelling, provocative, disturbing, Presumed Guilty is the fascinating story of one lawyer's relentless efforts to find the truth behind one of the most complex and notorious murder cases in American history.</ul></p><p><b>Matt Dalton</b> spent thirteen years as a prosecutor involved in all aspects of criminal litigation with the Long Beach, California City Prosecutor and the Los Angeles County District Attorney.

Advertisers have historically promoted food in distinctly gendered terms, returning repeatedly to themes that associated shopping and cooking with women. Foremost among them was that, regardless of the actual work involved, women should serve food to demonstrate love for their families. In identifying shopping and cooking as an expression of love, ads helped to both establish and reinforce the belief that kitchen work was women's work, even as women's participation in the labor force dramatically increased. Alternately flattering her skills as a homemaker and preying on her insecurities, advertisers suggested that using their products would give a woman irresistible sexual allure, a happy marriage, and healthy children. Ads also promised that by buying and making the right foods, a woman could help her family achieve social status, maintain its racial or ethnic identity, and assimilate into the American mainstream.</p><p>Advertisers clung tenaciously to this paradigm throughout great upheavals in the patterns of American work, diet, and gender roles. To discover why, <i>Food Is Love</i> draws on thousands of ads that appeared in the most popular magazines of the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, including the <i>Ladies' Home Journal, Good Housekeeping, Ebony, and the Saturday Evening Post</i>. The book also cites the records of one of the nation's preeminent advertising firms, as well as the motivational research advertisers utilized to reach their customers.</p></p><p><b>Katherine Parkin</b> teaches history at Monmouth University.Katherine J.

At a Syrian market, two Christian women are sold as slaves to a young merchant named Mohammed who is searching for truth as well as riches. One of the slaves, Lollia, is eventually sold to the Lady Paulina and taken back to Rome, once the center of the world, but now fallen into disrepair and menaced constantly by the hostile Lombards just outside the walls. Inside the city, the starving people are completely dependent on Bishop Gregory for food. Paulina struggles with the new doctrine of purgatory taught by Gregory and her own sense of unworthiness before God. The other slave, Amina, travels with Mohammed&#39;s caravan back to Mecca. There she attempts to share Christ with those around her, including a blind girl named Aseeyah, who embraces the gospel and seeks to influence her tribe in the true worship of God. As the years pass, Mohammed declares himself to be the prophet of God and begins to convert people by persuasion or force. In Rome and Arabia, Lollia, Paulina, Amina and countless others fall into the bondage of man-made religions and must learn at last to find true freedom in the Lord Jesus Christ alone.</p><p></p><h2>The Classical Centre: Goethe &amp; Weimar Seventeen Seventy-Five to Eighteen Thirty-Two</h2><p>"It draws on a profound knowledge of European literature, its argument is coherent from beginning to end, it is compellingly written."--Times Higher Education Supplement. While in Weimar, Goethe wrote literature which gave his country an artistic and intellectual center and contributed to its subsequent unification. T.J.

From Bill Moyers's PBS series on Genesis to the massive circulation of <em>Biblical Archeological Review</em> to such bestsellers as <em>The Book of J</em> and <em>Who Wrote the Bible?</em>, evidence abounds of an intense interest in the day-to-day reality reflected in the scriptures. Now Susan Niditch offers a perceptive, accessible account of the religious beliefs and practices of the ancient Israelites, analyzing the complex and varied ways in which Israelites present and preserve themselves in the Old Testament.<br> In <em>Ancient Israelite Religion</em>, Niditch illuminates the life and the customs of this ancient people, whose religion has so influenced human history. Drawing on the most recent literary scholarship and archaeological evidence, the book gives readers a compelling account of how Israelite culture changed through the three great periods of their past--the distant pre monarchic age, the monarchies of Israel and Judah, and the Babylonian exile and return. The heart of her book is a rich account of the Israelites' religious life, as revealed in the anthology of ancient Israelite writing called the Hebrew Bible. Niditch explores how they described their experience of God, drawing out consistent themes in the Biblical stories. For example, God is often identified with fire (as in Moses' encounter with the burning bush), and several women experience annunciations--revelations that they will give birth to a male hero. Niditch offers fascinating insight into the practices of folk religion, surmising that Israelites often made contact with the dead through mediums--a practice seen in the story of King Saul, who had the spirit of Samuel conjured up. She notes that the Bible is filled with condemnations of these and other customs, suggesting how widespread they actually were. Niditch goes on to explore the Israelites' mythic narratives, and the legal and ethical dimensions of a faith founded upon the Israelites' covenant with God. Strikingly, their code includes much that is unsavory to the modern mind, such as slavery and the stark subordination of women, and there are hints in the Bible of the practice of child sacrifice. The author also paints a detailed picture of the complex rituals--many centered on the purifying power of blood--that Israelite writers portray as framing their daily and annual patterns of life. <br> Most important, Niditch's account allows us to see the world through the Israelites' eyes, as she reconstructs both their habits and their larger worldview. Her insightful, subtly nuanced portrait brings to life this ancient people whose legacy continues to influence, and fascinate, the world today.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Susan Niditch</strong> is Samuel Green Professor of Religion at Amherst College. She is the author of numerous books on the Bible, including <em>War in the Hebrew Bible: A Study of the Ethics of Violence.</em><br>An overly brief but very well organized and informative overview of Judaism's formative stage during the 13th to 5th centuries b.c. Bible scholar Niditch (Religion/Amherst Coll.) focuses on the worldview expressed in the Hebrew Bible. She devotes chapters to four aspects of that worldview: the experiential, the mythical, the ritual, and the ethical-legal, largely basing her analysis on close readings of biblical texts. Sometimes, though unfortunately not often enough, she uses insight garnered from archaeological findings or the texts of other ancient Near Eastern religions. Niditch's greatest strength is her succinct, accessible prose; there is solid scholarship, but no academic pretentiousness or jargon here. She is particularly good at capturing and evoking an aspect of ancient Judaism in a sentence or a phrase. For example, after exploring the Yom Kippur ritual of the scapegoat that is prescribed in Leviticus, she observes how it is linked to other biblical rituals involving uncleanliness and danger, then concludes that ``sin, like the seductive personification in the story of Cain and Abel, the one who crouches at the door, is real and visceral, a contaminant which makes impossible a healthful continuation of the covenant community.'' Also enhancing her book is an excellent bibliography. The work's only weakness is an occasional penchant for deriving conclusions from insufficient evidence. An example: Niditch states that the context and content of the ritual of redeeming the first-born son (see Exodus 22) ``seems to be support that child sacrifice was indeed a thread in ancient Israelite religion.'' Far more evidence is needed for this spectacular claim. On balance, though, this is a first-rate introduction, for undergraduate and graduate students and all serious students of Judaism, to the social, cultural, intellectual, and spiritual underpinnings of the Hebrew Bible.

It is also a love story about living in the city, something exceedingly rare in teen fiction, and while decidedly set in 1982 (with a fun foray back to the pre-WWII era), it has a contemporary realistic feel. Nothing terrifying happens in this book, nothing horrifying or disturbing. The divorce is tough, but August learns to voice his feelings and navigate an honest path with his mother who is a wonderful sort of parent who gives him the kind of freedom that most tweens dream about. The most refreshing thing about this novel was how I didn't have to worry about it the kids have their big secret but it's a fun secret, a secret of parks and picnics and skating down the halls of the National Gallery. It's a secret that hurts no one and readers are allowed to simply enjoy how the friendships unfold and the revelations are made. The People of Pineapple Place is a perfect title for precocious younger readers who want a secret, but not something to worry about. --Colleen Mondor, Bookslut</p><h2>All Things Guy: A Guide to Becoming a Man that Matters</h2><p>All Things Guy: A Guide to Becoming a Man that Matters is written for boys ages 9 through 14. <br><br>The chapters include: <br><br>Dignity <br>Virtues and More <br>Media and Men that Matter <br>Vocations <br>Family and Friends <br>Body <br>Know Your History <br>Boys in the Kitchen Strong <br>Catholic Men of Today <br>Basic Combat Training: <br>Developing a Prayer Life <br><br>All Things Guy: A Guide to Becoming a Man that Matters also includes mazes, brain teasers and other fun activities that engage boys like building a bow and arrow.</p><p>I love this book!

Index. References. Illustrated with tables and figures.</p><p>In this book Martindale (psychology, Univ. of Maine) develops an evolutionary theory of aesthetic history based upon computer analyses and quantitative experiments with human subjects. He compares his abstract evolutionary theory with theories in pure science, arguing that demand for novelty gained with the least effort drives art history in an orderly and predictable fashion. He outlines his theory in the first two chapters and spends the remainder of the book describing his experimental proofs. Martindale states that his theory is objective and based on a deterministic view of reality--an assertion at odds with contemporary chaos theory and gender or ethnic criticism. Martindale insists that such approaches are philosophy, not science, but his experimental samples are predominantly white, Western, and male. Recommended only for libraries serving subject specialists.<br><i>- Lucy Patrick, Florida State Univ., Tallahassee</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Martindale contends that the quest for novelty is the engine driving artistic and literary creation. He also believes "art tends to evolve in a social vacuum. . . . With a few exceptions, poetry has always been written for other poets. Painters really paint for each other." Applying computerized content analysis to everything from Chaucer to French poetry, Gothic architecture, classical music and Egyptian painting, this University of Maine psychology professor attempts to prove his evolutionary theory to the effect that the "artistic muse" operates like clockwork, with trends in aesthetic styles occurring in extremely regular, periodic fashion. His massive number-crunching yields paltry insights. But students of Harold Bloom's literary theories may find this hermetic approach of interest for its discussion of "arousal potential" and "primordial content" in creative works. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bit and Spur Makers in the Texas Tradition, Pocket Guide</h2><p>This handy pocket-sized edition of the larger book by the same name packs all the essential reference material into a more portable edition.

As a young woman, brilliant, charismatic, and eternally curious, Marsha Danziger transformed herself into Magda Danvers, taking the academic world by storm with her controversial treatise on visionaries, The Book of Hell. She was already a star when she came upon Francis Lake in a midwestern seminary and married him, to everyone&#39;s surprise, including their own. It was a mating that seemed perfect: Magda pursued her career, and attentive, caring Francis devoted himself to Magda. Now, Magda&#39;s grave illness puts their marriage to its ultimate test. Even as she faces her &#34;Final Examination,&#34; Magda&#39;s genius does not desert her. From her bed she continues to arouse her visitors with compelling thoughts and questions, which will change the lives of some of them. Into the heady atmosphere of Magda&#39;s provocative repartee comes Alice Henry, fresh from her own family tragedy. Magda&#39;s room soon becomes a refuge for Alice from her crumbling marriage to brooding Southern novelist Hugo Henry. But is it the incandescence of Magda&#39;s ideas that draws Alice, or the secret of &#34;the good marriage&#34; that she is desperate to discover? For Alice, Hugo, Francis, and Magda will learn that the most ideal relationship - even a perfect marriage - doesn&#39;t come without a price. Gracefully written, keenly insightful, intimate in its revelations, The Good Husband reverberates with the lives of its characters, their histories, and the most urgent longings of their hearts - a triumph of the novelist&#39;s art, from the author of A Mother and Two Daughters, The Finishing School, A Southern Family, and Father Melancholy&#39;s Daughter, all of which were New York Times bestsellers.<b>Gail Godwin</b> is a three-time National Book Award finalist and the bestselling author of twelve critically acclaimed novels, including <i>A Mother and Two Daughters, Violet Clay, Father Melancholy&#x2019;s Daughter, Evensong, The Good Husband, Queen of the Underworld, </i>and<i> Unfinished Desires</i>.

The traitor Ealdred seeks to sell a holy book to the Emperor Charlemagne which will ensure riches beyond his wildest dreams. Greed drives him forward, but a band of fearsome warriors is in pursuit across the sea to Charlemagne's Frankish empire -- with the bloodiest of revenge on their minds.<br><br>Slaughter is certain as the Fellowship trap Ealdred and his men at the mouth of the river Sicauna in Frankia. Sigurd the Lucky challenges Ealdred's bodyguard Mauger in an ancient duel called the holmgang, and only one will walk away with his life.</p><p>GILES KRISTIAN is half Norwegian but was born in Leicestershire. He divides his time between London, New York and Norway. <b>Raven: Sons of Thunder</b> is the second book in a planned Viking trilogy.Chapter One<br><br>You do not betray a Fellowship and live to see your hair turn white. For a Fellowship is an honor-� and oath-�forged thing, as strong as a bear, as fast as a dragon ship, and as vengeful as the sea. If you betray a Fellowship, you are a dead man, and Ealdorman Ealdred of Wessex had betrayed us.<br><br>With the sail up and the spruce oars stowed, the men looked to their gear. They took whetstones to sword edges, patiently working out the notches carved in battle, and the rhythmic scraping was to me a soothing sound above their murmured conversations and the wet whisper of Serpent&#x2019;s bow through the sea. Men laid mail brynjas across their knees, checking for damaged rings, which they replaced with ones taken from brynjas stripped from the dead. Two of the Norsemen were throwing a heavy-�looking sack back and forth, grunting with the effort. The sack was filled with coarse sand, and if you put your mail in it and threw it around, the sand would clean the rust from the mail and make it like new again. Other men were smearing their brynjas with sheep grease, winding new leather and fine copper wire around sword grips, mending shield straps, and stretching new hides across the limewood planks. Dents were hammered out of helmets, spear blades were honed to wicked points slender enough to skewer a snail from its shell, and ax heads were checked to make sure they would not fly off at the first swing. Silver was weighed, furs were examined, and men argued or grumbled or boasted about the booty they had piled in their journey chests. We combed fleas from our beards and hair, relived fights, exaggerating our deeds and prowess, played tafl, checked Serpent&#x2019;s caulking, and laid leather strips in boots to fix holes. We nursed wounds, exchanged stories about friends now sitting at �din&#x2019;s mead bench in Valh�ll, watched gulls soaring high above, and reveled in the creak of the ship and the low thrum of the rigging. And all the while we believed that Nj�rd, god of the sea, who is kind to those who honor him, filled our sail and that we would soon spy our quarry, Fjord-�Elk, as a speck on the sunlit horizon.<br><br>For we were blessed with a lusty following wind and were making good progress so that the land of the West Saxons was soon little more than a green ribbon on the horizon to the north. If Nj�rd&#x2019;s favor held, Sigurd would sail Serpent through the night to try to shorten the distance between us and Fjord-�Elk, and when we came across her and the treacherous men who sailed her, our swords and our axes would run red.<br><br>Asgot the godi produced a hare from an oiled sack. It was a mangy thing that must have been kicking and scratching furiously ever since we set off, for its fur was sweat-�soaked, its mouth was bloodied, and its eyes were wild with fear. The godi took its head in one old fist, drew his wicked knife, and jabbed it into the animal&#x2019;s chest. Its long feet ran hopelessly in the air. Then Asgot dragged the blade along the hare&#x2019;s belly. Some of its guts fell across Serpent&#x2019;s sheer strake, and still it kicked as though it hoped to dash across a summer meadow. Then he wiped the bloody knife on the hare&#x2019;s fur, sheathed it, and ripped out the rest of the guts&#x2014;�the throbbing heart and the dark twine of the creature&#x2019;s intestines&#x2014;�and threw them into the sea, followed by the carcass itself. We watched for a while as the waves bore the tiny offering away, and then Serpent carried us on and the hare was lost among R�n&#x2019;s daughters. All the while Asgot spoke to the gods, asking them to bless us with fair seas and good weather. Father Egfrith made the sign of the cross to ward off Asgot&#x2019;s old magic, and I believed he was muttering counterspells, though I stayed away, not wanting those Christ words to maggot into my ears.<br><br>It would be a blood-�drenched fight, this one. A real gut ripper. For Ealdorman Ealdred of Wessex and his champion, Mauger, were feckless, snot-�swilling whoresons who had betrayed us all. Ealdred had the holy Gospel book of Saint Jerome, which we had stolen from the king of Mercia, and the toad&#x2019;s arsehole was racing now to sell that Christian treasure to the emperor of the Franks, Charlemagne, or King Karolus as some called him then. The worm would become as rich as a king, having betrayed us and left us for dead. But Ealdred&#x2019;s god and that god&#x2019;s peace-�loving son were not strong enough to make all this happen. They could not save him from us who held to the true gods, the old gods who still shake the sky with thunder and curse the ocean with waves as high as cliffs. And I believed that we would catch the half-�cocked maggot the next day or the day after that, because the English did not know Fjord-�Elk, did not know her ways. For ships are like women&#x2014;�you cannot touch one in the same places as another and hope to get the same ride. But Sigurd knew every inch of Serpent, and his steersman, Knut, knew every grain of salt in every rolling wave. We would catch the En- glish, and then we would kill them.<br><br>&#x201c;These Christians know how to puke, Raven!&#x201d; Bjorn called, the sunlight gleaming across his teeth. &#x201c;The fish will eat well today, I think.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And we shall eat the fish and therefore be eating Christian puke,&#x201d; I said in Norse so that Cynethryth would not understand.<br><br>She and Penda leaned side by side over the sheer strake, emptying their guts into a sea so calm that Bjorn&#x2019;s brother, Bjarni, was bailing Serpent&#x2019;s bilge with all the urgency of a cow on its way to the slaughter. I had seen Serpent flex and writhe like a supple sea creature, so that water continuously seeped in through the seams of her clinkered hull. But not that day. On that day the sea was as calm as a breeze-�stirred lake, yet it was enough to curdle the Saxons&#x2019; stomachs. The Norsemen were grinning and laughing at the two new crewmen, and though I pitied Cynethryth, I was happy it was not me they were laughing at this time, because I had done my share of puking in the early days.<br><br>As for Penda, the Wessexman was as vicious a man as I have ever known, and I had seen him slaughter the Welsh outside Caer Dyffryn so that the green pasture turned blood-�slick. But Penda did not look vicious now with his spew splashing onto the glasslike surface of the sea.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not fucking natural to float across the sea on a piece of kindling,&#x201d; Penda said, turning from the ship&#x2019;s side and dragging the back of his hand across his mouth. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not civilized,&#x201d; he growled, and I smiled because Penda was as civilized as a pail full of thunder.<br><br>Sigurd grinned knowingly at me because he knew I had stood in Penda&#x2019;s shoes not so long ago, but though that was true, I would never have referred to Serpent as &#x201c;kindling.&#x201d; I had always appreciated her workmanship, because I had been apprenticed to old Ealhstan the carpenter, and so I knew woodcraft when I saw it. Serpent was a beauty. Seventy-�six feet in length, seventeen feet in the beam, and made from more than two hundred oak trees, she originally could accommodate sixteen oarsmen on either side, but Sigurd had built raised fighting platforms at bow and stern, meaning that now there was space for only thirteen rowers on each side. With our crew of thirty-two men and one woman, it was to my mind a little cramped but not uncomfortable. Olaf told me that on one of Sigurd&#x2019;s expeditions, when Serpent was newly built and before he had Fjord-�Elk, she had carried a double crew of seventy warriors, one crew resting while the other rowed. That surely must have been a useful thing when it came to a fight, but I could not imagine sharing sleeping space with so many fart-stinking men. The ship had a small open hold for trade goods and supplies and a sturdy mast step and keel. She was fourteen strakes high and had a great square sail of wool that had been dyed red, and at her bow stood the head of J�rmungand, the Midgard-Serpent that encircles the earth. That beast&#x2019;s faded red eyes stared out across the gray sea into our futures. Every Norseman aboard, every warrior sitting on the sea chest containing his possessions, respected Serpent as he respected his mother, loved her as he loved his wife, and relished her as he relished his whores.<br><br>Cynethryth turned around, palming sweat from her forehead, and I swear her face was as green as a new fern. She caught my eye and seemed embarrassed, and so I looked away, pointing out to Black Floki a length of tarred rope caulking that was working itself free of two of the strakes beside him. The Norseman grunted and with a gnarled thumb began to press the thin rope back in. Once I had thought Floki hated me, but we had since grown close, as sword-�brothers do. Today, though, it seemed he was back to his miserable, brooding self.<br><br>Father Egfrith, as far as I could tell, suffered no ill effects from Serpent&#x2019;s motion, and maybe that had something to do with Glum&#x2019;s having cracked open his head with a sword blow. Somehow the little monk had survived. Worse than that, he had chosen to come aboard&#x2014;�an odd path for a monk, to board a ship full of heathens&#x2014;�and maybe that had something to do with the sword blow, too. He was a sniffling little m�rd, a weasel, but in a strange way I admired him because he must have known that any of us could squash him like a louse if he gave us reason or merely for want of something else to do. Truly, the Christ slave believed he would turn Serpent into a ship full of Christians, just as he boasted that his god had turned water into wine. Though if you ask me, turning Norsemen into Christians would be more like changing wine into piss. Perhaps he even hoped to change Serpent&#x2019;s name to Holy Spirit or The Jerusalem or Christ&#x2019;s Hairy Left Ball or who knows what? Egfrith was a fool.<br><br>By the time the day&#x2019;s heat had been chased away by a cold breeze wh...</p><h2>Bach. Beethoven. Brahms. (EFS 9)</h2><p>The best of the three B&#39;s in one volume. Biographies included.</p><p></p><h2>Ariel: Jan Morris, A Literary Life</h2><p>Jan Morris is one of the great British writers of the post-war era. Soldier, journalist, writer about places (rather than &#x2018;travel writer&#x2019;), elegist of the British Empire, novelist, she has fashioned a distinctive prose style that is elegant, fastidious, supple, and sometimes gloriously gaudy. For many readers she is best known for her candid memoir <i>Conundrum, </i>which described the gender reassignment operation she underwent in 1972.<br><br>But as <i>Ariel</i> demonstrates,<i> </i>this is just one of the many remarkable facts about her life. As James Morris she was the journalist who brought back the story of the conquest of Everest in 1953 and who discovered incontrovertible evidence of British involvement in the Suez Crisis of 1956. She has been described by Rebecca West as the finest prose stylist of her time, and her essays span the entire urban world. Her many books include a classic on Venice, a 1,600 page history of the British Empire, and a homage to what is perhaps her favourite city, Trieste. Her writings on Wales represent the most thorough literary investigation of that mysterious land.<br><br>Derek Johns was Jan Morris&#x2019;s literary agent for twenty years. <i>Ariel </i>is not a conventional biography, but rather an appreciation of the work and life of someone who besides being a delightful writer is known to many people as a generous, affectionate, witty and irreverent friend. It is published to coincide with her 90th birthday.</p><p>Derek Johns has been a bookseller, editor, publisher and literary agent. He is a former trustee of English PEN and a member of the Advisory Committee of the Man Booker Prize for Fiction. His novel <i>The Billy Palmer Chronicles</i> was published in 2010. He lives in London."Those unfamiliar with Morris's life will enjoy Ariel...Johns quotes copiously from the Morrisonian oeuvre. He catches his quarry well with adroit turns of phrase." - <i>Observer</i><br><br>"As well as analysing her style, this book also reminds us that Morris was, fundamentally, a bloody good journalist." - <i>The Times</i><br><br>"[an] elegant little volume, which is as much an anthology of excerpts from Morris's writings as it is a 'literary life'...Derek Johns, who was Morris's agent for 20 years, has written an affectionate portrait, although not a hagiography...Her writings should be celebrated and enjoyed, and <i>Ariel</i> provides an admirable introduction to them and to Morris's peripatetic life." - <i>The Sunday Times</i><br><br>"Morris, on the basis that she doesn't do journeys, has never regarded herself as a travel writer, but she is undoubtedly one of the great conjurers of place. Anyone who has enjoyed that aspect of her work will enjoy Derek Johns's tribute." - <i>The Daily Telegraph</i><br><br>"Johns, a novelist in his own right, knits his materials elegantly, adroitly and with affection." - <i>New Statesman</i><br><br>"Morris has always rejected the idea of a biography. But Derek Johns was her literary agent for two decades and knows her and her output well, so, with her help (and her own delightful line drawings), he has written a 'literary life' - really an affectionate memoir, which is shortish, sharp and full of insight... Johns describes her as 'generous, witty, irreverent and affectionate', and suggests that, if she has a religion, it is kindness. He has shown skill and sensitivity in chronicling Morris's brave and cheerful journey through life, where travel has often been a vehicle for an expression of inner transformation." - <i>Literary Review</i><br><br>"...what Johns offers is much more than a patchwork of extracts. His own prose is elegant and his insights incisive, and though he is affectionate he is not always uncritical." - MAGGIE FERGUSSON<br><br>"...a discreet, affectionate presentation of the writer&#x2019;s work, somewhere between a biographical essay and a compendium, Johns&#x2019;s words are in effect a framing device, to usher in Morris&#x2019;s own. <i>Ariel</i> is unusual because &#x2013; apart from anything else &#x2013; most biographers aren&#x2019;t granted permission to quote at such length. Morris&#x2019;s delicate line drawings are a highlight." - <i>Daily Telegraph Books of the Year</i><br><br>"Perhaps the best descriptive writer of our time." - Rebecca West<br>"I don't think there's a writer alive who has Jan Morris's serenity or strength." - Paul Theroux</p><h2>Creative Pencil Drawing.</h2><p>World Famous artist Paul Hogarth presents step-by-step treatment of tools and techniques for pencil drawing.,,</p><p></p><h2>The Silent Steppe: The Story of a Kazakh Nomad Under Stalin</h2><p>This is a first-hand account of the genocide of the Kazakh nomads in the 1920s and 30s. Nominally Muslim, the Kazakhs and their culture owed as much to shamanism and paganism as they did to Islam. Their ancient traditions and economy depended on the breeding and herding of stock across the vast steppes of central Asia, and their independent, nomadic way of life was anathema to the Soviets. Seven-year-old Shayakhmetov and his mother and sisters were left to fend for themselves after his father was branded a &#34;kulak&#34; (well-off peasant and thus class enemy), stripped of his possessions, and sent to a prison camp where he died. In the following years the family traveled thousands of miles across Kazakhstan by foot, surviving on the charity of relatives. Told with dignity and detachment, this central Asian Wild Swans awakens the reader to the scale of suffering of millions of Kazakhs, and also astonishes and inspires as a most singular survivor&#39;s tale.</p><p>Mukhamet Shayakhmetov was a member of a traditional Kazakh nomadic tribe. His trials began early, when the Soviet government&#39;s drive to collectivise farming and herding reached the vast steppes of Russia&#39;s central Asian empire, and specifically east Kazakhstan.</p><h2>Manual of the Third Order of St. Francis of Assisi</h2><p><p>This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.</p><p>This work is in the public domain in the United States of America, and possibly other nations.

Droll, probing, and honest, Shawn explores the many ways we all become who we are, whether through upbringing, genes, or our own choices, creating "an eloquent meditation upon the mysteries of personality and family"* and the struggle to face one's demons.</p><p><b>Allen Shawn</b>&nbsp;is the author of the critically acclaimed&nbsp;<i>Wish I Could Be There</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Arnold Schoenberg's Journey</i>. He is a composer and pianist, and has written for&nbsp;the&nbsp;<i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>, the&nbsp;<i>New York Times Magazine</i>,&nbsp;and other publications. He lives in Vermont and is on the faculty of Bennington College.<i>Starred Review.</i> The author's rampant agoraphobia and compensatory claustrophobia leave him terrified of almost any unfamiliar space, including highways, fields, elevators, bridges, tunnels, heights and airplanes; a walk down a country lane leaves him panting and paralyzed with fear. In this absorbing memoir, Shawn&#x2014;a composer, son of legendary <i>New Yorker</i> editor William Shawn and brother of actor Wallace Shawn&#x2014;approaches his panics from several angles. He explores the neurophysiology of phobic fear as an exaggerated, partly hereditary version of the innate human response to environmental threats. But he also offers a heavily Freudian account of his own panics, linking them to his parents' overprotectiveness and the resulting psychosexual and oedipal conflicts he suppressed from childhood onward. The latter perspective informs his vivid portraits of his family life; his brilliant, conflicted father, who suffered from similar phobias; and his autistic twin sister. Drawing on the writings of fellow agoraphobes like Emily Dickinson and Blaise Pascal, Shawn makes his fear of vast, exposed spaces a metaphor for humanity's existential predicament, an inchoate realization that "our brief life span is surrounded on all sides by nothingness." The result is both a lucid explication of psychopathology and a deeply felt evocation of a "pain in the soul." <i>(Feb. 7)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Reprint.</p><p>Lowcountry cooking--the food of South Carolina's coastal plain--is a refined mix of English, French, African, and West Indian culinary traditions. John Martin Taylor's <i>Hoppin' John's Lowcountry Cooking</i>, a collection of more than 200 accessible recipes, is the preeminent modern source for this treasured fare. Published in 1992, the book has become a classic, not only for the good food it presents but for Taylor's evocation of a homegrown American culinary style that flourished before the Civil War and remains a living cuisine. Beginning with a fascinating introduction to Lowcountry cooking--it's not the dishes that define it, but "the nuances of combination and a respect for the past" that make it unique--Taylor then provides ingredient notes and recipes for characteristic pantry preparations such as the dried spice and herb-intensive seafood boil. Recipes include She-Crab Soup, Benne Wafers, Duck and Sausage Gumbo, and that marvelous apple-nut sweet, Huguenot Tort. Included also are chapters on rice and grit dishes (among them, of course, Hoppin' John, the rice-and-pea specialty), a section on game dishes (Fried Quail with Sausage and Oyster Cream is irresistible), formulas for relishes like Sweet Watermelon Pickles, and for confections such as pomona, a traditional mixed-fruit "sugarplum."

The Hallmark Channel based a television series on Debbie&#x2019;s popular Cedar Cove books. For more information, visit her website, www.debbiemacomber.com.From the moment Rosie Cox entered Cedar Cove's divorce court, she'd felt a renewed sense of failure&#x2014;not to mention betrayal. Who <i>wouldn't </i>feel that way? After seventeen years of what she'd believed to be a reasonably good marriage, Zach's infidelity was the last thing she'd expected.<br><br>He'd never openly admitted to the affair. She hadn't found her husband in a compromising situation, hadn't found any concrete evidence&#x2014;no matchbooks from expensive restaurants, no jewelry receipts or motel bills&#x2014; but in her heart she knew. A wife always does.<br><br>Rosie owned up to the truth&#x2014;she was angry and she'd expressed that anger by making this divorce as complicated and difficult as she possibly could. Why should she go easy on Zach or walk away from their marriage without one hell of a fight? And fight she had, with both fists raised.<br><br>As she turned away from the judge, the final decree in her hand, she realized she'd made another mistake.<br><br>Rosie had <i>assumed </i>that once the divorce was granted, the anger and bitterness of these dreadful months would be lifted. Wrong again. An even heavier burden had been added. When the joint custody agreement she and Zach had so carefully worked out, point by point, was presented to Judge Olivia Lockhart, the judge had rejected it.<br><br>Instead, Judge Lockhart had stated that it was emotionally detrimental to kids to shuffle them between residences every few days. Allison and Eddie needed stable lives, according to Judge Lockhart, and <i>they </i>hadn't asked for the divorce. Some people considered the judge innovative, Rosie thought, disgruntled. How about interfering? Or out of her mind? Because&#x2014;of all the crazy settlements&#x2014;she'd awarded the children their house. That meant Rosie and Zach would be the ones moving in and out.<br><br>Talk about ridiculous! Talk about impossible.<br><br>Now that the divorce was final, Rosie and Zach would have to figure out some kind of living arrangements. The ramifications of what they'd agreed to were starting to hit Rosie and she hadn't even left the courtroom.<br><br>"Rosie," Sharon Castor, her attorney, said as soon as they were in the silent hallway outside the courtroom. "We have to meet with your ex-husband."<br><br>One look told Rosie that Sharon was as flustered as she was herself.<br><br>Otto Benson, Zach's lawyer, joined them. Although he remained outwardly calm, his face was tense. She dared not glance in Zach's direction. In fact, she'd avoided looking at her ex-husband from the moment she'd walked into the courtroom.<br><br>"Let's get a conference room and discuss the details," Zach's attorney said.<br><br>Rosie peered at Zach, standing behind his lawyer. He didn't seem any happier than she was with this decision, but she'd keel over in a dead faint before she let him know how she felt.<br><br>"Rosie and I should be able to work this out ourselves," Zach said with an edge of irritation.<br><br>Given the way everything had gone so far, that suggestion wasn't promising. "If you remember, it took us weeks of haggling to come up with this joint custody agreement," she pointed out. She enjoyed reminding him what a jerk he'd been. Rosie supposed Zach was hoping to avoid more attorneys' fees. Too bad. If he ended up with less money to spend on his girlfriend, that wasn't her concern.<br><br>Fists clenched, Zach snarled something under his breath. Probably just as well she couldn't hear it, Rosie decided, proud of her own display of self-control.<br><br>"What makes you think we're capable of agreeing to anything without a mediator?" she asked sarcastically.<br><br>"Fine," Zach muttered, with a pout reminiscent of their nine-year-old son. Staring at him now, Rosie had trouble believing she'd ever loved Zachary Cox. Not only was he smug and argumentative and self-righteous, he had no idea what it meant to be a husband and father. Granted, Zach was a handsome man; not only that, his appearance proclaimed his success as a businessman, a professional. Although, in her opinion, anyone with half a brain would instantly peg him for an accountant. He had that narrowed look about his dark eyes, as if he spent too many hours a day squinting at columns of tiny numbers. Despite that, he was appealing to the eye with his broad shoulders&#x2014; which nicely set off his expensive suit&#x2014;and thick, dark hair. At one time he'd been an athlete, and even now he routinely jogged and kept in shape.<br><br>Rosie had loved the firmness of his muscles as she stroked his back during lovemaking. Of course, it'd been months since they'd slept in the same bed, and much longer since they'd actually made love.<br><br>Rosie didn't even remember the last time. Had she known, she might have appreciated it more, lingered a moment longer at her husband's side, savored the feel of his arms around her. One thing was certain: Zach hadn't been interested in her from the day he'd hired Janice Lamond as his personal assistant.<br><br>The thought of him entwined with Janice nearly suffocated Rosie and she forcefully shoved the image from her mind. Anger and revulsion at her husband's&#x2014;no, ex-husband's&#x2014;unfaithfulness rose like bile in the back of her throat.<br><br>Zach's raised voice caught her attention; apparently he'd agreed to have their attorneys negotiate this added complication to their divorce decree. Otto was checking with the clerk for an empty conference room.<br><br>Once a private room in the law library was secured, Zach and his attorney sat at one side of the table, across from Rosie and hers.<br><br>Even the attorneys seemed perplexed by the situation. "I can't say I've ever heard of such a decree before," Sharon said, starting the conversation.<br><br>"Me, neither." Otto frowned. "This is one for the books."<br><br>"Fine," Zach said in a curt voice, "it's unusual, but we're both adults. We can figure this out. I know <i>I </i>was sincere about putting the children first." He glared at Rosie, as if to suggest she hadn't been.<br><br>"If you were sincere, you would've had second thoughts about sleeping with that slut." Rosie hadn't intended to be argumentative, but if her ex-husband was so concerned about their children's welfare, he would never have broken his wedding vows.<br><br>"I refuse to dignify that remark by responding to it," Zach said through gritted teeth. "Besides if you were home more, instead of volunteering for every cause known to mankind, every cause <i>except </i>your children, you'd&#x2014;"<br><br>"Well, I refuse to allow you to blame me for what <i>you've </i>done." Her volunteer efforts were Zach's big complaint. He had his wish; she'd had to resign from every position she held and seek paid employment. She hoped he was happy. For the first time since their children were born, Rosie wasn't a stay-at-home mom.<br><br>"I thought we were here to discuss this divorce decree?" Zach asked with a bored look, an expression that was obviously for her benefit. "If we're going to trade insults I'd rather not pay our attorneys to listen."<br><br><i>That's right, </i>Rosie mused, deriving a small sense of satisfaction out of knowing that Zach was responsible for both sets of attorneys' fees. He was the one with the high-paying job. She was currently taking summer classes to update her teaching certificate. Classes Zach was paying for. That was another notch in her belt&#x2014;another concession granted in their divorce settlement.<br><br>Her application was in with the South Kitsap School District and, considering all her connections, she shouldn't have any difficulty getting hired as a substitute teacher in September.<br><br>"Let's make a list of what we can agree on," Sharon said briskly, ignoring the antagonism between Rosie and Zach. "Despite the breakdown of your marriage, you both claim you want to keep the needs of your children first and foremost."<br><br>Rosie nodded and so did Zach.<br><br>Sharon smiled. She was a no-nonsense woman who wasn't swayed by emotion. "Okay, that gives us a place to start."<br><br>"I want to compliment you both on your attitudes," Otto said, removing a legal pad from his briefcase as if to prove he was earning his pay. Zach had chosen the best and, for that matter, so had Rosie. Both attorneys came with high price tags.<br><br>"Yeah," Zach said sarcastically. "If we got along any better, we might've stayed married."<br><br>"You know who to blame for that," Rosie snapped.<br><br>"Yes, I do," he snapped right back. "How many nights were you actually home? How many dinners did you cook? If you don't remember, I do. Damn few."<br><br>Sharon sighed audibly. "Okay, the kids come first, and at this point, they have the house, which means Rosie will need to find somewhere else to live for the three days a week when Zach's staying with them."<br><br><i>Somewhere else to live? </i>Rosie's head jerked up as the shock ran up and down her spine. The reality&#x2014;the repercussions of the judge's edict&#x2014;had just started to sink in.<br><br>"<i>And </i>pay half the mortgage on the house," Zach added, smiling at her benignly.<br><br>"But I can't&#x2014;" Rosie hadn't realized, hadn't thought that far in advance. "I don't have a job yet&#x2014;how am I supposed to afford an apartment on top of everything else?" This was grossly unfair. Surely Zach could see that such a demand was unreasonable. She had a life, too, and no way of building it if every penny she earned went into paying for two separate residences.<br><br>Rosie stared at Zach. He returned her look, unblinking.<br><br>"I have a suggestion," Sharon said.<br><br>"Let's hear it." Zach's lawyer sounded eager, if not desperate, for ideas.<br><br>"If Zach spends three days a week at the house with the children, then his apartment will sit empty, is that right?" She turned to Zach for verification.<br><br>Rosie studied him, too. In essence, Sharon was asking if Zach intended to move Janice into the apartment, Janice and her son, who was the same age as Eddie.<br><br>"The apartment will be empty," Zach said emphatically.<br><br>"What if&#x2014;" Sharon glanced from one to the other "&#x2014;Rosie moves into the apartment during the time you're at the house? You did say it was a two-bedroom apartment, didn't you?"<br><br>Objections shot up like weeds in Rosie's fertile mind. She didn't want anything to do with Zach. She certainly didn't want to be put in a situation where she had to deal with being around him or his things&#x2014;or what had been <i>their </i>things. Nor did she want to be privy to any information regarding his relationship with his girlfriend.<br><br>"No way am I letting Rosie in my apartment." Apparently Zach shared her qualms. "We're divorced. It took months to get that way. Rosie wanted out and she got her wish."<br><br>"You were the one who moved out," she reminded him scornfully.<br><br>"Correction. You kicked me out."<br><br>"If you'll recall, <i>you </i>insisted I see an attorney." She couldn't believe how convenient his memory was.<br><br>Zach snorted and looked at Sharon. "More fool me."<br><br>Rosie's attorney raised both hands in a pleading gesture. "Listen, it's just a suggestion&#x2014;a way of saving money for you both." She turned to Rosie. "You'll be fortunate to find a place, even a studio apartment, for less than five, six hundred dollars a month."<br><br>"Zach will have to pay&#x2014;"<br><br>"The hell I will!"<br><br>"The divorce is final," Otto Benson stated. "Zach isn't responsible for anything more than what's already been agreed to."<br><br>Rosie's gaze flew to her attorney, and Sharon reluctantly nodded. All at once, this was more than Rosie could bear. Not only had she lost her husband, but now she was being forced out of her home, too. Moisture welled in her eyes, and she managed to blink it away. Hell would freeze over before she let Zach know what he was doing to her.<br><br>A long moment passed before Zach finally spoke. "Okay, I'll agree to let Rosie stay in the apartment on the days I'm at the house, as long as she's willing to split the rent."<br><br>Rosie was well aware that she had no choice, but she did have her pride and she was determined to hold on to that. "On one condition," she insisted, lifting her head.<br><br>"Now what?" Zach asked with a long-suffering sigh.<br><br>"I don't want you bringing that woman into the family home. I want our house to be a safe place for the children. In other words, I don't want Allison and Eddie exposed to your women."<br><br><i>"What?" </i>Zach glared at her as though she'd spoken a foreign language.<br><br>"You heard me," she said vehemently, meeting his angry eyes. "This divorce has been hard enough on the kids without you parading Janice or any other woman you decide to date through my home. I want the house off-limits to your...your floozies."<br><br>"Floozies?" Zach smirked. "Fine, no <i>floozies. </i>And the same goes for you. I don't want you bringing any men to the house, either. No studs, no hotties, no boy toys, no&#x2014;"<br><br>"Oh, that's rich," Rosie broke in, putting an end to his ridicule. In seventeen years she'd never so much as looked at another man. Not since the day she'd met Zach.<br><br>"Do you or don't you agree?" her ex-husband challenged.<br><br>"Of course I agree!"<br><br>"Good."<br><br>"Perfect."<br><br>With their attorneys present, they made decisions about a number of other issues, and Sharon quickly wrote up an agreement. Zach's attorney reviewed it, and then both Zach and Rosie signed it.<br><br>By the time she left the courthouse, Rosie felt as if she'd been pummeled by wave after wave in a stormy sea. Strange as it seemed, her heart actually ached. For weeks she'd dreaded this day and at the same time longed for it, just so the divorce would finally be over. Now she wasn't sure <i>what </i>she felt, other than this deep pain that threatened to overpower her.<br><br>Nine-year-old Eddie was shooting baskets when Rosie pulled into the driveway at 311 Pelican Court. In a little more than a month, school would start again. Perhaps then their lives would return to some semblance of routine.<br><br>Eddie caught the basketball and held it against his side as he waited for her to park the car in the garage. His sad dark eyes watched Rosie as he stepped aside so she could drive past.<br><br>Fifteen-year-old Allison was in the kitchen, microwav-ing a hot dog for lunch. She turned and stared at Rosie, eyes glittering defiantly. She resembled Zach so much just then.<br><br>"How'd it go?" Eddie asked, following Rosie into the kitchen. He continued to hold the basketball.<br><br>"All right, I guess."<br><br>The microwave beeped and Allison removed the steaming wiener, devoid of a bun. As if it had suddenly lost its appeal, she set the plate on the countertop and studied Rosie.<br><br>"There's been a...minor complication," Rosie announced. She didn't believe in hiding the truth from her children, especially when it involved something that would affect them.<br><br>"What kind of complication?" Eddie asked, pulling out a kitchen chair. He balanced the basketball on the table, one hand supporting it.

Usually that&#x2019;s not news. As chief sorcerer of Felport, someone <i>always </i>wants her dead. But this time she&#x2019;s the target of a renegade assassin who specializes in killing his victims over days, months, or even <i>years</i>. Not to mention a mysterious knife-wielding killer in black who pops up in the most unexpected places. To make matters worse, an inmate has broken out of the Blackwing Institute for criminally insane sorcerers&#x2014;a troubled psychic who can literally reweave the fabric of reality to match her own traumatic past.<br><br>With her wisecracking partner Rondeau reluctantly in tow, Marla teams up with a &#x201c;love-talker&#x201d; whose dangerous erotic spells not even she can resist. Together they&#x2019;re searching the rapidly transforming streets of Felport for a woman who&#x2019;s become the Typhoid Mary of nightmares, infecting everything&#x2014;and everyone&#x2014;she touches with a chaos worse than death itself.</p><p>T.A. Pratt lives in Oakland, California with partner H.L. Shaw, and works as a senior editor for a trade publishing magazine.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>The Bentley squealed to a halt at the top of the icy horseshoe driveway before the looming brick face of the Blackwing Institute. Marla leapt from the passenger side and rushed for the front doors, purple-and-white cloak billowing after her in the gusty winter wind. The blade of the slim dagger in her hand crackled with blue sparks of paralytic magic, and she held colored pebbles in her left fist, each capable of neutralizing one of the five senses. Even deaf, blind, paralyzed, and unable to smell, taste, or feel, Elsie Jarrow would be lethal, but Marla's charmed weapons would at least level the field.<br><br>Marla paused at the entryway. With her hands full she couldn't haul open the heavy wooden double doors, carved all over with symbols of calming and confinement, and she couldn't exactly clench the paralyzing knife in her teeth. Fortunately Rondeau caught up with her then. He had a butterfly knife in one hand, which would be about as useful for fighting Elsie Jarrow as a damp bath towel, but Marla appreciated the effort. Rondeau did have one magical weapon&#x2014;he could Curse, blaspheming in the primal language that predated the fall of Babel, but the effects of such a Curse, while impressively destructive, were unpredictable, and Elsie Jarrow fed on chaos. Marla had told him to keep his mouth shut. Rondeau tugged open the door with his free hand, and Marla ran in&#x2014;almost colliding with Dr. Leda Husch in the foyer. Husch's pale, classically beautiful face was soot-smudged, and she clutched one arm, which must have been injured, but she was here, and whole, and wasn't a few shreds of exsanguinated flesh scattered on the floor, as Marla had expected.<br><br>"Jarrow has been contained," Husch said. <br><br>Marla narrowed her eyes, looking for any telltale signs of mental domination. Husch had been director of the Institute for a long time, since its creation, but that didn't mean she was immune to the powers of her patients. But the woman's eyes were clear, and she had no microfacial tics, so she was probably clean.<br><br>"It's all right," Husch said. "Poe wrote on both."<br><br>Marla relaxed. She took off her cloak and draped it over her arm. No need to wear that any longer than necessary.<br><br>"Poe did what, now?" Rondeau said, flipping his knife closed.<br><br>"It's an answer to that Alice in Wonderland riddle, 'Why is a raven like a writing desk?'" Marla said.<br><br>"It's also our all-clear code phrase," Husch said. "So Marla knows I'm really me, and that I haven't been coerced or turned into a zombified slave or anything. Jarrow is in the reinforced bunker below the boiler room. It should hold, though I wouldn't mind if you refreshed the binding spirals before you leave."<br><br>Marla dropped the sense-nullifying stones into her pocket. She glanced at the still-crackling knife in her hand, then jammed the blade into a wax apple in a fruit bowl on a side table. The energy couldn't be dismissed&#x2014;it had to be used&#x2014;but who cared if a wax apple got paralyzed? It was an improvement, even&#x2014;now the apple would never melt. "Okay. How did you stop Jarrow? When you called, you said she'd escaped her rooms, discorporated two orderlies, and was trying to find a way through the outer walls. We drove about ninety miles an hour down all those icy country roads to get here, and Rondeau's a shitty driver at half that speed. If I hadn't put a no-skid spell on the tires, we'd be upside down in a ditch somewhere. So, what, were things not as bad as you thought?"<br><br>"Oh, they were bad," Husch said, still clutching her arm. "But we found Jarrow unconscious in a third-floor hallway. Something knocked her out. One of our other patients did escape, though."<br><br>Marla braced herself. Was it Roger Vaughn, the mad sorcerer determined to sacrifice the world to a dark god that didn't actually exist? Norma Nilson, the nihilomancer, who had driven whole towns to suicide? Ayres, the necromancer with the Cotard delusion, who believed he himself was a corpse? None of the other patients in Blackwing was as dangerous as Elsie Jarrow, but they were all confined at the Institute for good reason. "Who got out?"<br><br>"Genevieve Kelley."<br><br>Marla frowned. "Who the hell's that?"<br><br>"One of my lesser-known patients. Not so much notorious as sad. Still, her escape . . . it's troubling. I'll tell you about her on the way to her room. But first, Rondeau, would you be a dear and help me pop my dislocated shoulder back in?"<br><br>"Sure thing," he said.<br><br>"Wow," Marla said. "That's more action than he got the time you guys went out." <br><br>They both glared at her, but Marla just grinned. She'd expected a fight to the death when she left Felport, and hadn't been sure she'd ever see her city again, but now things weren't so bad. Marla had never heard of Genevieve Kelley, and even though the woman's tenure in the Blackwing Institute meant she was some kind of crazy and some flavor of magical, Genevieve couldn't be too dangerous if her name had never come up before. Marla made a point of educating herself on potential threats. It was all part of her job as Felport's protector, and head of the unruly tangle of sorcerers that lived there.<br><br>Rondeau wrenched Husch's arm back into place. The doctor grimaced, then relaxed, and looked up at Rondeau with a radiant smile. <br><br>"Okay, you're fixed," Marla said. "Tell me about the runaway, and show me the scene of the crime. I've got an appointment today and I need to get back to the city soon, country mouse."<br><br>***<br>Marla stood before the gaping hole in the southern wall of Genevieve Kelley's room, arms crossed against the cold, looking down at the snow-covered back lawn. There were no footprints or other marks of passage there, nothing marring the ground but a curved scatter of bricks which had, this morning, been part of the wall. It was too cold in here to talk comfortably, so Marla caressed the edges of the hole, whispering to the bricks and mortar, coaxing them into remembering the bricks that used to touch them, and after a moment a sort of shimmering gray ghost wall shuddered into existence, filling the hole, and the cold wind ceased ripping through the room. The patch wouldn't last for long, but it would do until the tireless orderlies&#x2014;all homunculi created by the Blackwing Institute's original owner&#x2014;could close it more permanently.<br><br>Marla stepped back and looked around the small room, with its single bed, bare walls, and plain wooden night table and dresser. "How long did Genevieve live here?"<br><br>"She's been a patient for fifteen years," Husch said, waiting by the door.<br><br>"She must not have much of a personality," Marla said. "Nothing on the walls, no personal effects, no knickknacks? Or did she take it all with her?"<br><br>"Genevieve has been catatonic for the duration of her stay. She was brought to me that way. I do have some of her personal items, in a box in the closet, but she was incapable of showing any interest in them."<br><br>"Rondeau?" Marla said.<br><br>"On it." He opened the closet door.<br><br>"Do you think Elsie Jarrow knocked the hole in the wall?" Marla said. <br><br>"Wouldn't have helped if she had," Husch said. "There are wards all around the building to keep her in, and they don't depend on physical walls. But she was prowling the building, looking for a weak spot in the binding spell, a crack she could slip through. It's a big building, and it's hard to keep up the protections on our budget." She looked pointedly at Marla, who was in charge of raising money from Felport's sorcerers to fund the Blackwing Institute&#x2014;a task that was thankless in every direction. "But no, I don't think Jarrow would have bothered knocking over the wall. She can walk through walls."<br><br>"So maybe Genevieve did this?" Marla said. Rondeau put a shoebox on the bed&#x2014;kind of a small box to fit a life in&#x2014;and she began sifting through the contents. A blurry photograph, showing a smiling woman in a sundress with her arm around an older woman, probably her mother. "Is one of these her?"<br><br>"The younger," Husch said. "She hasn't aged a day."<br><br>Marla grunted. Lots of sorcerers didn't age when they were sleeping or comatose, or otherwise unconscious. It was one of the little tricks of extending your life, and one Marla had recently taken up herself. In her twenties, she'd felt invincible and eternal, and had scorned such magical life-extension as sops to vanity, but as her thirties unspooled and she took on more responsibility, she began to see the practical benefits. Of course, most nights she managed to sleep only four or five hours anyway, so it wouldn't help her as much as it did those who rested on a more regular schedule. "So she's been unconscious all this time? Why don't I see feeding tubes?"<br><br>Dr. Husch shrugged. "We used to try. But her state was almost one of suspended animation. Her body rejected sustenance. She never took in food, or voided her bowels."<br><br>"So was it some kind of a sleeping-beauty curse?" Marla sorted through the box. Not much to help her. There was a long yellow silk scarf, a hairbrush with a mother-of-pearl back, a couple of seashells, a book of Robin Hood stories, and that was it. Rondeau scooped up the book, sat down in a corner, and began flipping through it. <br><br>"By all accounts, Genevieve put herself to sleep," Husch said. "Though it wasn't voluntary. Fifteen years ago she was a promising psychic, apprenticed to an older sorcerer here in Felport, learning to use her powers. She had a great gift for creating illusions, I'm told. But in the first summer of her apprenticeship, she was attacked, physically assaulted on the street. She didn't know enough yet to protect herself magically, and though she fought back . . ." Husch shrugged. "He was bigger than her. You're a woman, Marla, and you haven't always been as strong as you are now. You know how it can be."<br><br>Marla nodded, then put the lid back on the box. Something like that had happened to her, too, when she was barely a teenager. Her brother&#x2014;back when he was a good guy, or at least a bad guy who was on her side&#x2014;had offered to kill the boy, but she'd asked him to teach her how to defend herself instead. She sometimes thought of that as the real beginning of her life; it had certainly placed her on a particular path. "Yeah. I do know. Did they catch the guy?"<br><br>Husch shook her head. "Genevieve was in no state to give a description. Her mind was already under a tremendous strain, as she was learning to use and control her psychic powers, and the trauma must have been even more horrible than usual. Can you imagine how much more terrible a rape would be if you could hear your rapist's thoughts, feel his feelings? If his senses became mixed up with your own?"<br><br>"Shit," Marla said. "I didn't even think about that." She sat down on the edge of the bed. "And after that, Genevieve just . . . shut down?"<br><br>Husch sighed.<br><br>"I see." But the Blackwing Institute wasn't a long-term-care facility or an old sorcerer's home. It was a prison for criminally insane sorcerers. "So what horrible thing did Genevieve do, to get locked up with the psycho killers and would-be world-destroyers you keep in here?"<br><br>"After her attack, she apparently wandered the streets in a daze until someone who recognized her guided her home. Her master&#x2014;a reasonably accomplished old probability-shifter named St. John Austen&#x2014;opened his door to her and brought her inside. And that was the last anyone saw of him. Or his house. Or the rest of that block. Sometime that night, Austen and his property vanished, replaced by an orange-tree grove. Genevieve was found sleeping in the branches of one of the trees, and one of Austen's associates brought her here, in terror the whole time that he and his car would be transformed into a piece of tropical fruit. Apparently the attack . . . tipped something over in Genevieve. Her power changed. In addition to creating illusions, she developed the power to reweave physical reality as well."<br><br>Marla whistled. Reweavers were rare as hell and more dangerous, and it was a blessing that most of them killed themselves by accident sooner rather than later. They could get right down to the atoms and move stuff around, change the face of the physical world, often with catastrophic unintended consequences. Some said the greatest reweavers were capable of changing even people's memories, but that was a tough hypothesis to prove, for obvious reasons. "Why an orange grove?"<br><br>Husch shrugged. "I don't know. There's an orange tree in that photo of her. Perhaps it represented a safe place. The orange trees died soon after anyway. The climate was all wrong for them. <br><br>Genevieve never woke up. She retreated into herself, away from the trauma of the attack, perhaps, or from the enormity of the ability she found inside herself. I've kept her here because she's too dangerous to house elsewhere. I knew the binding spells wouldn't stop a determined reweaver, but, well . . . I didn't worry about Genevieve much. It's a bit like having a nuclear bomb tucked away in some corner of your house. Terrifying, yes, but over time, you get used to it. And she was asleep, after all."<br><br>"Something woke her up today," Marla said. "Probably Elsie Jarrow, shoving at every magical wall she could find, knocking down Genevieve's mental defenses in the process, freaking her out. But where the hell did she go? And why didn't she leave any footprints?"<br><br>"Ah," Husch said. "As to the latter, I have . . . a hypothesis. Come to my rooms. I want to show you some of the security tapes. They're frightfully boring, for the most part, as you'd expect from footage of a catatonic. But there are some interesting moments."<br><br>"Okay," Marla said. "Rondeau, bring the box. Some of that stuff might be useful."<br><br>***<br>Images flickered on the old television as Husch fast-forwarded through a few hours of surveillance tape. "We don't keep all the footage, of course. And we have to re-use the same tapes over and over, because we can't afford new ones every day, but I check them daily for warning signs. And I keep any recordings that seem noteworthy. Like this one." She stabbed the "Play" button.<br><br>Marla leaned in close. On-screen, grainy sunlight streamed into the room from the windows in the southern wall&#x2014;the wall Genevieve had blasted apart that morning. Genevieve herself lay sleeping in her narrow bed, hands at her sides, and then she was gone, like a jump-cut in the tape. Marla grunted, noting the time stamp, which rolled on at one second per second. The tape hadn't been spliced. Genevieve had just disappeared. "Does she&#x2014;" Marla began, but then Genevieve reappeared, curled in the fetal position. A scatter of small objects appeared with her, drifting down from a spot midway up in the air, like torn pieces of paper, maybe, or&#x2014;</p><h2>To California on the Southern Route 1849: A History and Annotated Bibliography (American Trails Series)</h2><p>Identifies and evaluates virtually every known source on the southern trails of the gold rush of 1849, citing some 130 diaries, journals, and reminiscences.

Set in the 1980s, in the affluence and sunshine of California&#39;s silicon valley, it is the story of twenty-somethings looking for love, pleasure and the meaning of life.</p><p>Can 690 sonnets, rhyming a-b-a-b-c-c-d-d-e-f-f-e-g-g, be a novel? Definitely! First published in 1986 and still fresh (the sole sign of its publication date being the frequent use of the word <i>yuppie</i>), Vikram Seth's <i>The Golden Gate</i> will turn the verse-fearing into admiring acolytes. Janet Hayakawa, a yet-to-be-discovered sculptor and drummer in the Liquid Sheep, secretly places a personal ad for her friend John, even though she too is single. "Only her cats provide distraction,/Twin paradigms of lazy action." The seventh letter does the trick. Lawyer Liz Donati's submission is two sonnets in toto and disarms John into meeting her. Soon they fall into brief bliss, as do her brother, Ed, and John's old college roommate, Phil. Unfortunately, the first couple's love is too soon destroyed, partly by a pet, partly by politics; and the second is rent by religion. Ed pulls away thanks to the Bible: "I have to trust my faith's decisions, / Not batten on my own volitions." <p> The rest of the novel leads less to the traditional comic ending--rapprochement and marriage all around--than to surprising sadness. But in between there is wit, wordplay, abounding allusion, and some marvelous animals, among them the iguana Schwarzenegger. The author even steps onto the stage on occasion: at a frou-frou publishing party a powerful editor accosts him, curious to hear about his new novel. When Seth tells him it's in verse, the temperature plummets. "'How marvelously quaint,' he said, / And subsequently cut me dead." Luckily, Seth's real editor did anything but.</p>"At once a bittersweet love story, a wickedly funny novel of manners and an unsentimental meditation on mortality and the nuclear abyss.

That nobody could deny.</p><p>They&#x2019;d started relatively gently, placing rods between his fingers and squeezing his hands in a kind of vise, to break the bones in his fingers one by one, but he&#x2019;d said nothing in answer to their repeated questions. Then they&#x2019;d subjected him to the searing agony of the strappado, tying his hands together behind his back, attaching weights to his feet, and then jerking him off the ground by a rope secured to his bound wrists. But still he&#x2019;d remained silent, even when they&#x2019;d used the red-hot iron to burn deep furrows in the flesh of his naked body, but when they lost patience and put him on the bed, he knew he would finally break.</p><p>They tied his body down, lashing his arms and legs with ropes so that he couldn&#x2019;t move at all, his feet projecting over the end of the iron frame. Then they coated his feet in oil, stoked the charcoal brazier, added more fuel, and positioned it just inches away from the soles of his naked feet. Almost instantly, a wave of unbearable agony swept through his body as he felt&#x2014;and could even smell&#x2014;his own flesh start to cook.</p><p>And then he screamed. A scream that cut through the dark and gloomy silence of the makeshift torture chamber located in the cellars under the Paris preceptory of the Knights Templar. A scream that sounded as if it could echo for a thousand years, or imprint itself forever on the dank stone walls of the chamber. A scream that sounded as if it might never end.</p><p>But it did. As the last of his breath was forced out of his lungs, the man jerked twice against his bonds and then lay still and silent, his ruined body limp.</p><p>&#x201c;Insert the screen,&#x201d; the inquisitor ordered.</p><p>The two torturers stepped forward and slid a thick and heavy plank of wood between the brazier and the feet of the heretic, feet from which smoke was rising and from which most of the skin had already been burned away, the flesh beneath blackened from the heat, blood dripping steadily onto the unyielding and stained stone floor.</p><p>For a few seconds the inquisitor said nothing more, just stared at the body lying in front of him. Then he seemed to come to a decision.</p><p>&#x201c;Try him.&#x201d;</p><p>One of the torturers stepped over to the brazier, wrapped a length of heavy cloth around the end of an iron bar which projected from the side of it, pulled it out, and moved across to stand beside the body on the metal bed. He looked across at the tall wooden chair in which the black-robed inquisitor was sitting, awaiting final confirmation. Then he lowered the glowing end of the bar on to the stomach of the heretic and simply left it there.</p><p>Again, the smell of burning flesh rose from the bed as the red-hot iron seared its way through skin and flesh, but the body of the man remained silent and motionless.</p><p>The inquisitor made an impatient gesture, and the two torturers began loosening the bonds from the dead body, preparing to drag the corpse out of the chamber.</p><p>&#x201c;If we go on at this rate, Brother Guillaume,&#x201d; the second inquisitor said, &#x201c;we will have none left to subject to the cleansing flames. How many is that now?&#x201d;</p><p>Guillaume Humbert, better known as Guillaume of Paris, the Grand Inquisitor of France and Confessor of the King, and the man given the task of extirpating the heresy of the Knights Templar, shook his head.</p><p>&#x201c;Do not be concerned. He is the twenty-third soul we have failed to save, another suicide prompted by our gentle and righteous questioning. There are plenty of others still awaiting our attentions.&#x201d;</p><p>The rules governing the use of torture by inquisitors were based upon a papal bull issued on 15 May 1252 by Pope Innocent IV and entitled Ad extirpanda, and were comparatively rigid. But, like all rules, they were subject to discussion and interpretation. No individual, for example, could be tortured more than once, but the inquisitors simply regarded each new session as nothing more than a continuation of the first or the previous interrogation, and would continue indefinitely, until they&#x2019;d either got what they wanted from the subject or he or she&#x2014;because with regard to the appalling danger of heresy the church made no special allowances for women&#x2014;was dead.</p><p>They were also forbidden to spill blood, to cause mutilation or death. This meant that no cutting instruments such as knives or pincers could be used, but crushing devices such as thumbscrews or iron boots which shattered the bones of the feet were felt to be entirely acceptable, and any mutilation which resulted was simply seen as an accidental by-product of the process, merely collateral damage. One favored technique was to extract the teeth, one by one and ignoring the comparatively small volume of blood which resulted as each tooth was pulled out, and asking a question before each extraction. Then they&#x2019;d probe the fresh cavity with a slim but red-hot spike if the answers failed to satisfy the inquisitors.</p><p>Death, when it occurred, was considered to be either an accident caused by the overenthusiastic application of a particular technique or instrument, or a deliberate act of suicide by an unreformed heretic, unable to speak the truth to his inquisitors. In fairness, as the task of the inquisitor was to save souls, torturing an individual to death was generally seen to be counterproductive, because of the certain knowledge that the soul of a suicide would be immediately and permanently consigned to the devil and the flames of hell. It would be an obvious and unfortunate failure of their task.</p><p>When Guillaume of Paris had begun his work, there were 138 members of the <i>Pauperes commilitones Christi Templique Solomonici</i>, or the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, more commonly known as the Knights Templar, languishing in the dungeons of their own preceptory, located just outside the city walls on the northern side of Paris. Thanks to the range of tortures applied, only 115 still remained among the living after exactly one month of questioning, and many of those would clearly not emerge from the building alive. And if Guillaume of Paris had his way, those that did survive would only be permitted to walk the short distance from the preceptory to the heavy wooden stake where they would end their days in the flames which would consume their bodies but ultimately, if the teachings of the church were to be believed, save their immortal souls.</p><p>The men chosen to extract detailed confessions of the heresies perpetrated by members of the Knights Templar were friars of the <i>Ordo Praedicatorum</i>, or Order of Preachers, the religious order approved by Pope Honorius III on 22 December 1216. They had become known as the &#x201c;Black Friars&#x201d; because of the black cappa, or cloak, they wore over their white habit, and from the fifteenth century onward they were commonly referred to as the Dominicans, after the name of their founder, Saint Dominic of Guzm�n. A more irreverent Latin name that would later be given to them was <i>Domini canes</i>, meaning &#x201c;Hounds of the Lord,&#x201d; a play on the name <i>Dominican</i>.</p><p>The order was founded to preach the gospel and combat heresy&#x2014;meaning anything that the church did not agree with&#x2014;and its motto was <i>Laudare, Benedicere, Praedicare</i>, which translated as &#x201c;To Praise, to Bless, to Preach.&#x201d; But there was little evidence of any such noble and intellectual paths being followed in the dungeons of the Villeneuve du Temple. Instead, the two black-robed friars spent their days sitting on their elevated wooden seats watching with total impassivity as a seemingly endless number of men were dragged into the chamber and their bodies progressively broken in front of them as the questioning, and the tortures, grew more intense.</p><p>The inquisitors knew, of course, that there was not the slightest possibility that any of the members of the Knights Templar were innocent of the charges laid before them. That would imply that the pope, Clement V, and the king of France, Philip IV, better known as Philippe le Bel or Philip the Fair, the men who, on Friday 13 October 1307, had orchestrated the arrest of every member of the Templar order they could lay their hands on, were both wrong. That could obviously not be the case, as Clement V, as the occupant of the Throne of Saint Peter, was relaying the word of God, Philip acting as his secular confederate. The guilt of the Templars, therefore, was undeniable, well-established and common knowledge, and all the inquisitors were doing was trying to extract signed confessions for the crimes and heresies that they were certain the knights had perpetrated.</p><p>Because their guilt was certain, no witnesses for the defense would ever be called, no denials of the charges accepted, and of course there was no possibility of counterarguments. Anything the accused men said apart from a confession was clearly intended as nothing more than a devious way of excusing their very obvious guilt, so it could be&#x2014;and invariably was&#x2014;disregarded.</p><p>And up to that point in the interrogations, most of the Templars had admitted to at least some of their crimes after only the mildest of torture techniques had been applied to them. Most, for example, had admitted denying Christ upon their reception into the order, and even more that they had spat upon a crucifix during some of their secret ceremonies. Because it was known that members of the Knights Templar were forbidden to enjoy carnal relations with women, it was widely believed that they engaged in homosexual activities, but this charge, perhaps unexpectedly, bearing in mind what they were suffering, was admitted by almost none of the imprisoned knights. On the other hand, most agreed that they had been required to indecently kiss their superior in the order, usually on the navel or at the base of the spine. In truth, and a fact that was certainly known but totally ignored by the inquisitors, according to the established rules of the Knights Templar, sodomy was regarded as an entirely sufficient reason for a knight to be expelled from the order, an offense which was considered just as serious as the murder of a Christian or desertion on the battlefield. And those knights who had admitted to this crime against nature had only done so when the agony of their tortures reached levels that almost no human being could endure.</p><p>Some other members of the order had admitted virtually everything the inquisitors suggested, in some cases even before they&#x2019;d received their first wound from the glowing iron bar or had any of their fingers broken, but others stubbornly refused to say anything no matter what persuasion was applied to them, and even after having been shown a forged letter purporting to have been written by the Grand Master of the Knights Templar, Jacques de Molay, in which he confessed to every crime and practice suggested by the inquisitors and urged his subordinates to promptly do the same.</p><p>And although Guillaume of Paris was satisfied with most of the answers he was extracting from the rank-and-file members of the order, there was one question about which he had been specifically ordered by King Philip to obtain an answer. So far every knight he&#x2019;d questioned had either denied any knowledge of this matter or had simply refused to reply. To make matters worse, it was not a question which directly related to what Guillaume privately regarded as the &#x201c;Templar heresy,&#x201d; but concerned an entirely different matter, definitively secular rather than religious.</p><p>In fact, it was a question that he did not feel was appropriate to ask in the circumstances, though he knew he had no choice in the matter. If he disobeyed the King, he knew he could easily find himself back in that selfsame torture chamber, but this time as a victim rather than as an interrogator. And he would do anything to avoid that happening.</p><p>Having disposed of the broken body of the last victim, the two torturers returned to the chamber and stood before the pair of inquisitors, awaiting further instructions.</p><p>&#x201c;Who do you wish to question next, Guillaume?&#x201d;</p><p>For a few moments, the Grand Inquisitor did not reply to his fellow friar, considering the strategy he would use for the next interrogation. The problem he had was that he was certain very few members of the Knights Templar order would know the answer to the question he&#x2019;d been told to ask, and that those high-ranking knights would probably be prepared to endure any torture, and even go to their deaths, rather than reveal that particular piece of knowledge. But he was certain that the Grand Master, the knight in charge of all the other Templar Masters around the world, would know the information he sought. The two other men likely to have had access to the information were Hugues de Pairaud, the Visitor of the Temple, and Geoffroi de Charney, the Preceptor of Normandy. A third possible knight was Geoffroi de Gonneville, the Preceptor of Acquitaine. None of these four men, all of whom were just yards away from the torture chamber, chained to the walls of the dungeons, would be likely to talk easily, and he dare not run the risk of any of them dying under interrogation. Those four were destined to publicly burn, or never emerge from prison again. His instructions in that regard had been most explicit.</p><p>But perhaps there was an alternative, a way of persuading them to give up the information without running the risk of permanently damaging them. They were, after all, four comparatively elderly men who would never be able to withstand the kind of tortures that a man in his twenties could tolerate.</p><p>Guillaume of Paris made his decision.</p><p>&#x201c;Bring in Jacques de Molay,&#x201d; he ordered.</p><p>Minutes later, the two torturers reappeared, half carrying and half dragging a bearded man with long white hair, barefoot and wearing a stained and filthy gray robe, who had clearly already suffered from the attentions of the inquisitors.</p><p>Against one wall of the chamber was a metal chair which was used to support a victim while his feet were being crushed in the iron boot, and Guillaume of Paris pointed at it.</p><p>&#x201c;Tie him to the chair,&#x201d; he ordered.</p><p>As soon as de Molay had been immobilized, one of the torturers seized the metal boot and placed it in front of the chair, and started to make it ready for use, but the inquisitor stopped him with a single command.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;go back and bring another one of the prisoners. One who has not yet been questioned, and who is young and strong and able to last the rest of the day.&#x201d;</p><p>The torturers nodded almost simultaneously, turned, and left the chamber. They were paid to use their strength and ability to inflict the maximum possible level of pain on their victims, and to work under the specific instructions of the inquisitors. In short, they were paid to listen and to obey, and not to talk.</p><p>&#x201c;Until today we have only questioned one man at a time,&#x201d; the second inquisitor said. &#x201c;Why are you involving a second heretic?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have received the most detailed orders from my master, the king,&#x201d; Guillaume of Paris said. &#x201c;There is one matter which concerns him deeply and which I have been instructed to resol...</p></p><h2>Wolf Tales</h2><p>Welcome To A World Where Nothing Is What It Seems And Every Touch Is Ecstasy<br><br>When Alexandria's car goes off the road in a terrible blizzard, she has no idea night will bring a powerful rescuer and the start of an ecstatic sexual awakening.

However, a murderous duel in 1859 killed &#34;Free Soil&#34; U.S. Senator David C. Broderick, and public opinion began to change. As war broke out back east, a golden-tongued preacher named Reverend Thomas Starr King crisscrossed the state endeavoring to save the Golden State for the Union. Seventeen thousand California volunteers thwarted secessionist schemes and waged brutal campaigns against native tribesmen resisting white encroachment as far away as Idaho and New Mexico. And a determined battalion of California cavalry journeyed to Virginia&#39;s Shenandoah Valley to battle John Singleton Mosby, the South&#39;s deadliest partisan ranger. Author Richard Hurley delves into homefront activities during the nation&#39;s bloodiest war and chronicles the adventures of the brave men who fought far from home.</p><p>Richard Hurley received his undergraduate degree from Harvard College and wrote for the Harvard Lampoon. He worked for three years in the history division of the Oakland Museum of California. He earned a master&#39;s degree in architecture from UC-Berkeley, then left the Bay Area for the Sierra foothills and a career in computer-based multimedia. Richard is co-author of the award-winning historical fiction Queen of the Northern Mines. He has authored multimedia shows and guest curated a museum exhibit on California and the Civil War."Many books and articles have examined important aspects of California's Civil War, but the literature has yet to produce a full-length and truly comprehensive study of the state's role in the conflict. There's little doubt that today's Californians as a whole are largely unaware of just how deeply and directly the 1861-65 war affected the Golden State, and Richard Hurley's California and the Civil War gamely attempts to inform the modern public about a significant moment in their history. A sweeping overview intended for a popular audience, the book is a more than solid introduction to the topic." <i>Civil War Books and Authors</i><br><br>"Richard Hurley has produced an informative and entertaining look at the impact of the Civil War on California and Californians' impact on the war. He intriguingly explores Golden State warriors' active roles throughout the southwest and in the Eastern Theater, where their cavalry skills were desperately needed. Hurley's humor and frank insights enhance the enjoyment of reading this unique study." <i>Edward Bonekemper, author of six Civil War books, including</i>The Myth of the Lost Cause: Why the South Fought the Civil War and Why the North Won<br><br>"Although the Civil War's titanic battles all took place far to the east, California was roiled by the conflict too. In this book, Richard Hurley brings the stories and colorful characters of the Civil War-era Golden State to vivid life. Anyone who thinks the Civil War didn't affect the Pacific Coast will come away with a whole new perspective." <i>Christopher L. Kolakowski, author of</i>The Stones River and Tullahoma Campaigns: This Army Does Not Retreat<i> and</i> The Civil War at Perryville: Battling for the Bluegrass<br><br>"Once I started reading <i>California and the Civil War</i> by Richard Hurley, I couldn't stop. History is my passion and my profession, and this is the first book I've read that accurately interprets California prior to and during the Civil War, as well as its role in that great conflict. Richard's rich, moving narrative not only kept my attention, but my enthusiasm. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has the slightest interest in history or California or reading in general. Everyone who reads it will enjoy it. <i>Ralph Gibson, museums administrator, Placer County Museums</i><br><br>"California and the Civil War is a clear and concise exposition on the Golden State's history from The Bear Flag Republic through 1865. Hurley presents the geography of the state as a way of discussing the political leanings of Southern immigrants and Northern immigrants. California played a crucial part in political challenges during the 1850s." <i>Civil War Librarian</i></p><h2>James Stirling: Admiral and Founding Governor of Western Australia</h2><p>Man of action, naval officer, able administrator, skilled diplomat - James Stirling&#39;s distinguished and multi-faceted career carried him to the four corners of the nineteenth-century world. This ambitious biography, seven years in the making, breaks new ground in documenting fully Stirling&#39;s path from birth into one of Scotland&#39;s oldest families, through to founder and Governor of the Swan River Colony and, ultimately, to Admiral and British naval chief in East Asia. Drawing on fresh archival material, author Pamela Statham Drew has fashioned an intricate tapestry of engrossing detail, set against a post-Napoleonic backdrop of colonial opportunism, wars, British naval superiority and shifting political alliances. Stirling&#39;s place in history has hitherto been questioned and over-simplified, particularly regarding his contentious West Australian land grants. This absorbing biography seeks to redress this bias while, at the same time, revealing much about the human face and foibles of the man remembered today as the founder of the State of Western Australia.</p><p></p><h2>Hell: A Novel</h2><p>Part mystery, part domestic meditation and part horror story, &#34;&#34;Hell&#34; is Davis&#39;s tour de force.&#34; (Joy Press, &#34;The Village Voice.&#34;) In her brilliantly eerie third novel, three households coexist in a single restless vision.</p><p>Kathryn Davis teaches at Skidmore College.Davis's third (The Girl Who Trod on a Loaf, 1993) is a tour de force made up of the surreal and the poetic, of skillful shifts in voices, settings, and eras--but, under the pyrotechnics, with a nagging sense of there being primarily the familiar and well trodden.

Cover: Hardcover.</p><p></p><h2>Armies of the Night</h2><p><p><i>The Armies of the Night</i> chronicles the famed October 1967 March on the Pentagon, in which all of the old and new Left&#x2014;hippies, yuppies, Weathermen, Quakers, Christians, feminists, and intellectuals&#x2014;came together to protest the Vietnam War. Alongside his contemporaries, Mailer went, witnessed, participated, suffered, and then wrote one of the most stark and intelligent appraisals of the 1960s: its myths, heroes, and demons. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award and a cornerstone of New Journalism, <i>The Armies of the Night</i> is not only a fascinating foray into that mysterious terrain between novel and history, fiction and nonfiction, but also a key chapter in the autobiography of Norman Mailer&#x2014;who, in this nonfiction novel, becomes his own great character, letting history in all its complexity speak through him.</p><p></p></p><p>Born in Long Branch, NJ, in 1923, and raised in Brooklyn, Norman Mailer was one of the most influential writers of the second half of the 20th century and a leading public intellectual for nearly sixty years. He is the author of more than thirty books. The Castle in the Forest, his last novel, was his eleventh New York Times bestseller. His first novel, The Naked and the Dead, has never gone out of print. His 1968 nonfiction narrative, The Armies of the Night, won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. He won a second Pulitzer for The Executioner&#x2019;s Song and is the only person to have won Pulitzers in both fiction and nonfiction. Five of his books were nominated for National Book Awards, and he won a lifetime achievement award from the National Book Foundation in 2005. Mr. Mailer died in 2007 in New York City.&#x201c;His genuine wit and bellicose charm, and his fervent and intense sense of legitimately caring, render <i>The Armies of the Night</i> an artful document, worthy to be judged as literature.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>Time</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Only a writer steeped in American life, with all his wits about him, and with a genuinely compassionate social vision, could have produced a work so acute in its historical insights and so moving in its portraits of contemporaries.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>The Nation</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Some time in 1969 in Paris, I first read <i>Armies of the Night</i>, Norman Mailer's account of the anti-Vietnam war march on the Pentagon... It was mesmerising, and to re-read it today is to experience an additional punch: the one that verifies that history repeats itself as (malignant) farce. Page after page you have the impression that he is commenting not on Lyndon Johnson's shameful war, but George Bush's corporate-powered skulking towards another self-serving war... supports the theory&#x2014;more resonant now than then&#x2014;that perhaps the most ruthless and prolonged jihad in history has been that of the American fundamentalist Christians, which began towards the end of the second world war.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Peter Lennon, <i>The Guardian</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Just as brilliant a personal testimony as Whitman's diary of the Civil War, <i>Specimen Days</i>, and Whitman's great essay on the crisis of the Republic during the Gilded Age, <i>Democratic Vistas</i>. I believe that it is a work of personal and political reportage that brings to the inner and developing crisis of the United States at this moment admirable sensibilities, candid intelligence, the most moving concern for America itself. Mailer's intuition in this book is that the times demand a new form. He has found it.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Alfred Kazin, <i>New York Times</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Mailer's feints and bell-donging around his fellow &#x2018;Notables&#x2019; is a late night popcorn joy, and there is much that is stylish and shrewd... this is an important and passionate pilgrimage.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>Kirkus</i></b></p><h2>India Black and the Widow of Windsor (A Madam of Espionage Mystery)</h2><p><b>Black is back-Her Majesty's favorite spy is off to Scotland in this new adventure to ensure the Queen doesn't end up getting killed. </b><p>When Queen Victoria attends a s�ance, the spirit of her departed husband, Prince Albert, insists she spend Christmas at their Scottish home in Balmoral.

She has written more than a dozen books, all respectfully reviewed, and won major honors. While building a reputation as a mistress of elegant, intricate fiction, she has for decades written perceptive and sometimes acerbic critical essays for the New York Review of Books, as well as the screenplay for "The Shining," the horrific Stanley Kubrick movie based on Stephen King's novel. Johnson is a multi-talented wordsmith. Through it all she has been a committed Francophile, who lives half of the year in Paris. Over a six-year span -- 1997 to 2003 -- with a trio of accomplished and witty novels, Le Divorce, Le Mariage and L'Affaire, she cornered the market on Franco-American fiction. Her sophisticated and somewhat condescending French characters and down-home American visitors assess one another in what the San Francisco Chronicle aptly called "an endless dance of profound incompatibility." She now turns her sights on Morocco, where France has exercised considerable cultural and political influence since the beginning of the 20th century. Lulu in Marrakech places Johnson's eponymous heroine, a freelance CIA operative, code-named "Bearer Angel," in one of Morocco's most mysterious and glamorous cities. Working under the pseudonym "Lulu Sawyer" (we never find out her real name), Lulu must collect information on any acquaintances who might be funding terrorists plotting attacks, training suicide bombers or compensating their bereaved families. Her CIA boss tells her to discover "who are the bankers," because "huge sums of money change hands in the souk, intended for jihad, never going near a bank." It then occurs to her that she has no idea how to accomplish such a dangerous and delicate mission. Lulu is a well-educated, reasonably attractive, youngish American woman who appears to be paying a prolonged visit to her lover, a stiff-necked Englishman named Ian Drumm. Lulu met Ian the previous year in Kosovo, where they were both working with civil war refugees. Happily for this underpaid government secret agent, her boyfriend now lives in a gated villa complete with verdant garden, swimming pool and multi-cultural houseguests. Ian, the son of an affluent British Lord, has industrial and real estate investments in Morocco -- what exactly they are is never quite clear. Lulu's cover is that she's doing research into illiteracy amongst Muslim women, who appear to live in a society with an almost impenetrable veil -- cultural and literal -- around their daily lives and ideas. The power of the veil surprises Lulu. After all, she says to herself, it is just a piece of cloth: "With nuns, no one thought about the veil, and now it was a principal article in dealing with vast political questions, such as Turkey joining the European Union." She also worries that she is not supplying her CIA handler with dramatic enough information and wonders if she'll ever find a card-carrying terrorist. Perhaps, she thinks, it would be easier just to marry Ian and retire from the secret-agent business. Meanwhile, she makes covert phone calls to her CIA contact from hotel lobbies and sets up a lending library, a project that "tallied nicely with my clandestine interests, since it turned out that a lot of intrigue was required -- asking people who were going to Paris or London to smuggle books back, for instance." Johnson lays out the life of the privileged foreigners and the watchful Moroccans in a fluent, wry, sometimes very funny style in the grand tradition of Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, who peopled their novels with laconic British colonials savoring the heat and hedonism of the British Empire. She catches every nuance of life in Marrakech. A pair of gay British men keep a tea shop; a French Muslim woman, fleeing the threat of an honor killing, works as a nanny; an American-educated Saudi-Arabian struggles with her arranged marriage; Col. Barka, a mysterious Moroccan colonel who is or is not working for the French or perhaps the Americans, befriends Lulu. All move seamlessly in and out of the plot. Johnson nails the fiber and oddity of this tightly wound society of ex-patriots -- the majority French and British -- as Lulu makes well-intentioned but mostly unsuccessful attempts to befriend "real" Moroccans. She finds that "the Europeans and the Moroccans were each afflicted with an eye disease that prevented them from seeing each other -- it was the perennial eye infection of colonialism." Initially, not much happens in the leisured life of the expatriates, except that Lulu worries about her relationship with Ian, and fellow houseguest Posy gets more and more pregnant, until suddenly events begin to unravel. Lulu finds herself involved in bomb attacks, violence and even murder. A pretty tall order for even a le Carr�-caliber spy, and Lulu doesn't exactly see herself as 007. "I saw that I wasn't going to be good at this kind of illegal, risky activity in my chosen profession. It was too late for me, I lacked the anarchic core. . . . I was too goody-two-shoes." Johnson is often a wonderful writer. Her characters and their setting have life, sounds and smells. Their conversations reveal much more than the characters themselves realize. But the foundations, the premises on which this story is built, are shaky. There is a sense of something missing, even in the midst of graphic descriptions of Marrakesh and its residents. The spy craft with scraps of paper and secret passwords feels more like a tale from the 1950s. Even in this fictional world, it's hard to believe that a somewhat ditzy and not that well-informed woman would be recruited by a U.S. espionage agency. She makes mistakes and takes risks that in real life would have blown her cover to smithereens. The novel has a curiously anticlimactic conclusion, too, almost as if the author suddenly tired of her story. Perhaps a double-agent story involving post-9/11 al-Qaeda-style terrorists is just too grim to lend itself comfortably to elegant and witty fiction. <br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

Rather than opening public pools, roller rinks and shops to African-Americans, many towns and private owners boarded up the doors. Wiles delivers her message incisively through the credible voices of her young characters, narrator Joe and his best friend, John Henry, whose mother works as housekeeper for Joe's family. Joe and John spend many hours swimming together in the creek because John is not allowed in the public pool, so on the day the Civil Rights Act is enacted, they visit the town pool together, excited about diving for nickels in the clear water. Instead they find a work crewAincluding John Henry's older brotherAfilling in the pool with asphalt. "John Henry's voice shakes. 'White folks don't want colored folks in their pool.' " The tale ends on an upbeat if tenuous note, as the boys walk together through the front door of a once-segregated shop to buy ice pops. Lagarrigue's (My Man Blue) softly focused, impressionistic paintings capture the lazy feel of summer days and affirm the bond between the two boys.

Written with the intelligence and grace that are the hallmarks of Anita Shreve&#39;s bestselling novels, this gripping tale of desire, jealousy, and loss is peopled by unforgettable characters as real as the emotions that bring them together.</p><p>Anita Shreve's <i>All He Ever Wanted</i> reads like Virginia Woolf's <i>A Room of One's Own</i> told from the perspective of the husband. The wife gains a measure of freedom, but how does the repressive, abandoned husband feel about that freedom? Set in the early 1900s in the fictional New England college town of Thrupp, and narrated by the pompous Nicholas Van Tassel, <i>All He Ever Wanted</i> is at once an academic satire, a period novel, and a tale of suspense. Shreve's ability to nimbly hop through genres brings a liveliness to this story of love gone depressingly wrong. Van Tassel is an undistinguished professor of rhetoric at Thrupp College and a confirmed bachelor when he meets--in no less flamy a scenario than a hotel fire--the arresting Miss Etna Bliss. Immediately smitten, he woos and wins her. At least, he persuades her to become his wife. But Van Tassel hasn't really won her. Etna keeps her secrets and her feelings to herself. The extent of her withholding only becomes clear after a couple of kids and a decade or so of marriage. Then we find out that she's been creating a secret haven for herself all along. Van Tassel is in turn revealed--through his own priggish, puffed-up sentences--as something of a monster. The book is cleverly done; watching Etna through Van Tassel's eyes is like looking at beautiful bird from a hungry cat's point of view. But Van Tassel's voice might be too well written; he's pedantic and dull and snarky all at once, and by the end we find that we, like Etna, can't bear his company a minute longer. <i>--Claire Dederer</i><br></p><h2>Hardening, tempering, annealing and forging of steel ;: A treatise on the practical treatment and working of high and low grade steel</h2><p>This book is a facsimile reprint and may contain imperfections such as marks, notations, marginalia and flawed pages.</p><p></p><h2>Flight of the Bluebird (The Unintentional Adventures of the Bland Sisters Book 3)</h2><p>Fasten your seat belts for some unexpected turbulence ahead, as Jaundice and Kale Bland are back for their final unintentional adventure!

The second volume of Hamsun&#39;s letters casts a revealing light on many fascinating aspects of Hamsun&#39;s private and public life. They demonstrate the tireless and total dedication to his writing which earned him worldwide recognition, as well as the personal anguish and joy which two marriages and a divorce brought him. They often reveal the strange juxtaposition of the warmly sympathetic and the unexpectedly repellent sides of his personality. Finally, they show the painful price he paid for his support of the Nazis during World War II. After the war he was tried and found to have &#34;&#34;impaired mental faculties.&#34;&#34; Rather than sentence him to prison, a massive fine was levied on him which made him destitute, and his wife and one of his sons were imprisoned for several years.

He evokes their thoughts and feelings about the meaning of life, and at the same time their insights into the religious beliefs of adults.</p><p>Robert Coles is a winner of the National Medal of Freedom.With his Children of Crisis series, begun nearly 30 years ago, and later studies about children's moral and political lives, Coles, child psychiatrist, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and Harvard professor, has taught a generation of adults how to listen to--and learn from--children. In this final volume of his work with children, Coles again relies on psychoanalytic observation, unintrusive questioning and meetings stretching over months and years, as he interviews, among others, Hopi children in the Southwest, Catholic, Protestant and Jewish children in the Boston area, Pakistani children in London and Christian children in Tennessee about what God means to them and how God fits in their lives. Often adding to their words with drawings (16 are reproduced here), the children, most around the age of 10, respond with fervency and depth that confirm Coles's close, respectful attention. There are no answers on these pages; only the children, vividly, eloquently present; Coles himself, who, declaring his own secular inclinations, fills out their responses, along with his to them; and the conclusion that intense considerations about the purpose of life and the nature of God occupy all of us, at every age--perhaps never so directly than as children.

This is her first full-length book.<b> Chapter One </b> <p> </p><p> </p><p> It changed everything: a school picture printed on the front page of the <i>Elk Grove Courier,</i> the newspaper my father was reading. I was eight. Sitting across the breakfast table from Dad, I pointed. "Who is she?" </p><p> "She's dead." </p><p> He kept reading. </p><p> "What happened?" I asked. </p><p> No answer. </p><p> I leaned forward to get a closer look. She looked like me: same short cropped hair with razor-straight bangs, same heart-shaped face, same wool plaid jumper. I looked at Dad: bloated, smudged glasses slid halfway down his nose. Why wasn't he telling me what happened? He loved talking gore; lived for it; documented it, even. </p><p> Dad drove his Ford pickup with his Kodak movie camera sitting shotgun just in case he saw an accident. If he was lucky enough to come upon something, he'd jump out and aim his camera at whatever was crumpled, bleeding, or burning. And every Thanksgiving he lined up Mom and the four of us kids on the gold-and-brown-plaid studio couch, hauled out the Bell + Howell reel-to-reel, and rolled his masterpieces. </p><p> Images jiggled past, scenes from our tiny Ohio town of Galesburg. Christmas morning, four beautiful children in color-coordinated Santa pajamas, squinting; summertime, my older brother Jamie's first home run; a station wagon hideously wrapped around a telephone pole, blood dripping down the passenger door and plop, plop, plopping onto the road; my two older sisters and me in hats with wide ribbons hunting for Easter baskets; a dead cow smashed on the front of a Plymouth. Our childhood was preserved among the big fire at the Catholic church, a Greyhound bus accident on Fort Henry Road, and a tornado twirling up Martha Whitmore's bean field. We all sat watching the movies and eating buttered popcorn made in the black-and-white-speckled pan that was always greasy, no matter how many times you scrubbed it. The disasters took up more reels than we did, and Dad narrated them like a pro. </p><p> So why was Dad skimping on the details about this dead girl? Maybe it wasn't bloody enough for him. </p><p> I couldn't get that school picture out of my head. I needed to know what had happened to that girl. If she was dead, something had killed her, and I wanted a heads up just in case whatever it was might be lurking nearby. </p><p> That night I casually swiped the newspaper off the cluttered coffee table and headed down the hallway to find my brother, Jamie. Nothing scared him. </p><p> He was sitting on his bedroom floor putting together a plastic model of a '69 Shelby Cobra Mustang. </p><p> "Can you read this out loud?" I held up the paper. </p><p> "Why can't you read it?" he asked, looking up from his project. He had most of the chassis put together. </p><p> "I can read it, but I want you to." He stared at me. I held up a Milky Way left over from my Easter stash. </p><p> I couldn't tell Jamie I didn't want to read the details of that girl's death by myself, especially with her staring out at me from the front page. I didn't want him thinking I was chicken. </p><p> "It has to be right now?" he asked. </p><p> "Mom says I have to go to bed in a minute," I said. </p><p> He twisted the lid back onto the blue-and-white tube of Testor's glue and wiped his hands on the filthy dishrag he kept in his supplies shoe box. </p><p> "Let's go," he said. I followed him to the dark landing of our musty basement, where the four of us kids congregated for secret business. </p><p> "Here," I said, handing him the paper and the candy. I was glad Jamie wasn't too curious. He hardly ever asked questions about anything. </p><p> We sat crouched on the landing. I held the silver flashlight with the words "Black and Decker" printed down the side. Dad owned a hardware store in downtown Elk Grove and earned the flashlight selling ten hammers in two months, but he tossed it to me when the lens cracked. Jamie and I sat facing each other cross-legged with our foreheads touching, staring down at the white circle of light. He began to read: "'Driver Faces Charges in Bike Rider Death' -- " </p><p> "Bike rider? She was killed on her bike?" I craned my neck to see the paper right side up. </p><p> "Do you want me to read this or not?" Jamie tore open the candy bar wrapper. </p><p> "Go ahead," I said, thinking of my own bike, a gold Schwinn with a leopard-skin banana seat. I'd spent hours running it up the wooden ramp Jamie had built beside the alley behind our house. Cars ripped through there without ever slowing down. </p><p> Jamie took a bite and began reading again: "'Mason County's fourth traffic fatality of the year occurred Tuesday afternoon with the death of Sarah Rebecca Keeler, eight-year-old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Keeler.'" </p><p> Eight years old? I was eight. I grabbed the paper to take another look. She was my age, but I didn't recognize her from school. I felt a pang of disappointment as I handed back the paper. </p><p> Jamie continued, "'Sarah Keeler was a member of St. Mary Catholic Church and was a third-grade pupil at St. Mary School.'" </p><p> That's why I didn't know her; she was Catholic. Catholics were considered the equivalent of snake handlers in our small Ohio town. I didn't know much about them except that they made Methodists like my parents nervous. This made Sarah more mysterious. Anyone who unnerved my parents was interesting to me. </p><p> "'Sarah was en route on North Highway 26 when struck by a car driven by Nowell Linsley, sixty-one. The report states death was apparently instantaneous, due to a basal skull fracture and a broken neck.'" </p><p> "What's a 'basal skull fracture'?" I asked. </p><p> "I guess her head broke open," Jamie said. He knew death. He'd buried dozens of small animals he'd found dead in the field behind our house, or cats and squirrels squashed by cars speeding through town on Highway 64. </p><p> I contemplated how hard I'd have to be hit by a car to have my head crack open like an egg. My oldest sister, JoAnn, had her head split open on the corner of the coffee table when we were little. Dad deliberately stuck his foot out and tripped her. He thought it was hilarious until bright red blood began trickling down her face. </p><p> I was trying to picture someone's whole head laid open, hair and brains and blood on the asphalt, when I began feeling woozy and sweaty. </p><p> "Hold the flashlight still," Jamie said. I shook my head and steadied the light. "'A Breathalyzer test was taken on Linsley, and he was charged by the sheriff's department for driving under the influence of alcohol.'" </p><p> "The guy was drunk," Jamie said, handing me the paper. I thought of Uncle Ernie, the only person I'd ever seen drunk. He'd come to our front door one night after running down the street from the dilapidated Galesburg Tavern, where another drunk had been hitting him over the head with a pool cue. Dad wasn't home. </p><p> Ernie's forehead was bleeding and Mom looked pale and nervous, especially when he asked to use one of her good bath towels. The next morning I heard Mom call him a "sweet drunk," so he'd probably never kill anyone on a bicycle. Even so, I'd be on the lookout for his white pickup. </p><p> That night I lay in my small wooden bed and relished the attention Sarah Keeler must have received. I fantasized that it had been me on that bike and I'd been struck from behind. I hoisted my arms above my head on the pillow and pretended to be lying on the road. In my fantasy my dad drove by and stopped, not because he recognized my bike (my dad had no idea what color my bike was); he stopped because it was potentially gory. He jumped out of the truck with his movie camera but realized it was me lying there -- bleeding and dying. <i>Double jackpot,</i> he thought: one less mouth to feed <i>and</i> he'd get all the attention. People would feel so bad for him. </p><p> Dad resisted the urge to film the scene, opting instead to bend over my limp body, pretending to be struck with grief. He was surprised when he could actually squeeze out tears. Everyone closed in around him...and that's when I canceled that fantasy. </p><p> If Dad shoved me out of the limelight even in my death scene, if he couldn't even love me while I was lying on the asphalt, there was no hope. </p><p> Maybe others would have been sad to see me dead in the street. I thought of Mom curled up in the nubby orange chair reading <i>Rich Man, Poor Man.</i> Surely she'd have been devastated. But Mom was a human cork; she floated to the top of any awful situation. My mom, who'd told me the earth was flat, always created her own reality. She would have been fine. </p><p> I was beginning to wonder if dying was such a good idea. </p><p> It wasn't as if I wanted to be dead; it was just that I was miserable and felt in the way most of the time. There was something wrong with me. I always knocked over my milk, I got sick every time we drove long distances in the car, and I wet my bed every night, even though I was in third grade. But when Dad started in on us, knocking Jamie across the kitchen and then kicking him in the side, or jerking my pants down in front of strangers, that's when death seemed possible, even preferable. </p><p> If God could make me normal like everyone else in my class, or pull me out from under the rage of my own father, I might be happy instead of nervous and ashamed all the time. </p><p> I remembered the funeral details Jamie had read: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><blockquote> Friends may call on Saturday at Kilner and Sons Mortuary between 4:00 and 8:00 P.M. On Sunday there will be Mass at St. Mary's, with burial following at Maple Creek Cemetery. </blockquote> <p> </p><p> </p><p> Until Sunday, when Sarah Keeler was sunk in a deep, lonely hole and the world forgot and moved on, I could pretend I knew her. I could wallow in the glow of her spectacular departure. Sunday was years away. </p><p> I woke up the next morning to sunshine and bushy green trees rustling outside my bedroom window. I rolled over and felt under my pillow for the newspaper. Still there. </p><p> I crawled out of bed to change my wet sheets and pajamas. Bed-wetting kept Mom from buying me a spiffy twin bed like the ones my older sisters, Becky and JoAnn, had. </p><p> Their fancy twins were on either side of mine, decorated exactly alike wi...</p></p><h2>Moments Divine</h2><p>A pious, extremely moving book of 30 short chapters, one for each day of the month, containing, first, a dramatic true story of the Eucharist,an ejaculation, a prayer, an act of contrition, a spiritual communion, the Anima Christi, a Sacred Heart Reading, plus a short concluding prayer.

It also delights in good food and a robust appetite, and the health and strength they can bring. Written at a time when many children were going hungry and even starving, Burnett's beloved story celebrates the magic of fresh air, new milk, homemade currant buns, and hearty, simple fare. <p> Inside the pages of this cookbook are recipes for Mary's favorite foods, in and out of the garden, from porridge to roasted potatoes and eggs, all inspired by <em>The Secret Garden</em> and all adapted by chef and culinary historian Amy Coder from traditional Victorian recipes. Ms. Coder has supplemented these simple, wholesome recipes with fascinating tidbits on Victorian foods and Victorian eating customs. The result is a scrumptious tribute to Burnett's classic novel, a fascinating glimpse into the cooking customs of a historical period that is now long past, and a step-by-step guide to making delicious, tasty treats to enjoy in your own secret garden.</p></p><p>Amy Cotler, is a professional chef and culinary historian as well as an avid gardener.

Elisha Eaker, scion of a wealthy Manhattan banking family, joins the Navy against his father&#39;s wishes. He does it as much to avoid an arranged marriage to his cousin, Araminta Van Velsor, as to defend the flag. Eli meets Lieutenant Ker Claiborne aboard the sloop of war U.S.S. Owanee. An Annapolis graduate who&#39;s seen action in the West Indies and the Africa Station, Claiborne is cool and competent in storm and battle, but he now faces an agonizing choice between the Navy he loves and his native Virginia. Whichever road he takes, he&#39;ll be called a traitor. With authentic nautical and historical detail, master sea-yarner David Poyer follows Eli, Araminta, Ker, and their loved ones and shipmates into a maelstrom of divided loyalties, bitter partings, stormy seas, governmental panic, political blundering, and, finally, the test of battle as the bloodiest and most divisive war in American history begins.</p><p><b>David Poyer</b> is the most popular living author of American sea fiction.

Her topmasts tilted above a spiky undergrowth of spars and shears. Smoke streamed from her single funnel off over the gray-green flatness of the East River, merging at last with the sooty pall from the thousands of other ships and homes and factories of Manhattan. </p><p> As Elisha Eaker dropped his boots into trampled mud, the smells of horse dung and coal ashes bloomed in his nostrils. He paid the hack off with a red-dog note, then stood coughing, holding a handkerchief to his lips as its wheels ground away. </p><p> Was it wise, to venture this? Was it really a way out? Or was all pride and folly, the disordered imaginings of a feverish brain? </p><p> Eli was tall and young, with pale, smoothly shaven cheeks. A sword tilted awkwardly at his side. He'd put on the regulation full dress for the first time that morning. Epaulettes from Warnock and lace from Tiffany's; a cocked hat and silk stock and gold-striped pantaloons. </p><p> Marine sentries in pomponed shakos and white gloves snapped to present arms as he reached the gate. He expected them to ask for a password, given the unrest in the city and, indeed, throughout the Republic this apprehensive spring. But they neither questioned nor hindered him, and after a moment he walked on, into the Brooklyn Navy Yard. </p><p> The sloop's masts loomed against the smoldering sky as he headed downhill past foundries and shops echoing with the clang of iron and the shouts of workmen. Her black sides towered from the murky bay. Even immobile, she looked somber and intimidating. </p><p> But did he belong here? Or was he only fooling himself? </p><p> He hesitated again, then pushed doubt away and marched up the gangway. His boot caught, and only the manrope saved him from flinging himself into the dark water that sloshed and bumped a frowsy lumber of dead rats and waterlogged dunnage. At the top he drew in a deep first breath of her, of the curious, deep, peculiar ship-redolence mingled and amalgamated of tar and brass polish, coal dust and slowly mortifying oak, of old food and the damp reek of packed-in men; and beneath it all the sweet, smoky cured-tobacco aroma of the hempen rigging that lifted above him like a frozen whirlwind up into the murky sky. </p><p> A stocky, bullet-headed petty officer aimed him a questioning scowl. Eli saluted him and said, -- Good day. My name is Elisha Eaker, and I am here to join your ship. </p><p><br> Lieutenant Ker Claiborne, U.S. Navy, first lieutenant and acting executive officer of U.S.S. <i>Owanee,</i> had slept for three hours out of the last forty-eight. Two days before, the yard commander had ordered her coaled and provisioned to sail at short order, and her just-dismissed crew remustered from the concert saloons, cider stubes, and panel houses of Five Points and the Bowery. Captain Trezevant had passed the command along with an ironic twist of the lips -- a sardonic humor Ker would have shared, if he had not been so disquieted of late. </p><p> He was in the teak-paneled wardroom, going over a bill of lading by the light of a gimbaled lamp, when one of the ship's boys, looking, as usual, as if he expected to be caned, rapped at the jamb. </p><p> -- What is it, Jerrett? Another of our lads back aboard drunk? </p><p> -- No sir. Gunner Babcock's compliments, and there's a gen'lman on the quarterdeck to see you. </p><p> A caulking hammer tapped somewhere. Ker dipped the pen; held the back of his wrist against his pointed beard, pondering; then etched a line in firm Spencerian. He glanced at the card the boy laid on his desk. -- Tell the gunner I will be up directly. Then carry this to Mr. Glass, if you please. </p><p> The boy vanished, and Claiborne rose, head brushing the varnished beams. He buttoned his coat and took his service cap off a peg. He studied a curved glass tube on the bulkhead. Then turned the lamp down, and went up the companionway. </p><p> The air on deck felt bracing after twenty-four months off West Africa. He'd contracted the fever of the country off the Guinea coast, and it came calling with chills and ague when he drove himself too hard. As he most likely was just now. </p><p> He touched his beard again, looking across the water not at the tropic continent but at his own country; but instead of comfort, memory and apprehension chilled his heart. When Owanee had deployed, two years before, the nation had been quiet. But since she'd returned, it seemed men had gone mad, lost their senses or been mastered by demons. </p><p> Like the Gadarene swine, he thought, we stampede blindly toward an infinite and fatal abyss. </p><p> Forward on the main deck, the gunners were scraping an amber paste of grease and varnish off the Dahlgren, flinging each bladeful into a tin bucket. A few yards aft, the boatswain was supervising a party swaying up the fore-topmast. At a pipe of his silver whistle the hoistlines tautened. The mast stood upright, then lifted its heel just clear of the deck, searching in the wind like an old man's uplifted and uncertain cane. Ker ran a critical eye over the rigging. He'd apprenticed to the art at Annapolis. The old school ship Preble had been just seaworthy enough to jog about the Chesapeake, but her sail plan and fitting out had been classic sailing Navy. Summer cruises to the Caribbean and Mediterranean on the <i>Plymouth</i> added experience of levanters and hurricanes, but it was off the coast of Africa that he'd become a master. Coal was scarce and dear, and <i>Owanee</i> had sailed through most of her service there. </p><p> A curious tableau awaited him on the quarterdeck. A fair-haired young fellow, not badly made, but whose pale face and slack posture gave the impression of a life spent at ease, stood beside the ship's gunner. He was in full dress, but wore no insignia of rank. Ker made him the abbreviated bow one gives a stranger of whose intention one is uncertain. -- Lieutenant Ker Claiborne, at your service. </p><p> -- My name is Elisha Eaker. Late of the firm of Eaker and Callo-well, of Manhattan. </p><p> -- Did you wish to see the purser, sir? If it is a matter of business. </p><p> Eaker hesitated, then drew a document from his sleeve. </p><p> Ker was pondering it when a hoarse snort bellowed from the smokestack. A black cloud shot up, then hovered between mainmast and mizzen like a cloud of summer midges. Greasy flakes fluttered down like black snow. </p><p> -- That turd Hubbard's doing, no doubt, and without the least concern for us topside, said the gunner angrily. </p><p> Eaker glanced around, at the morose-looking seamen, the rows of heavy guns that lined the waist. He flicked a flake of soot from his sleeve. -- Could we perhaps...? </p><p> And Ker said, -- Certainly, sir. If you'll accompany me below? </p><p><br> Eighty feet aft, a scraping clang sounded from within a well of darkness. A moment later a little man in grease-stained denims and a cap with a broken bill emerged headfirst from beneath an iron casting that extended from the shadowy bilges to thick glass skylights thirty feet up. Their pearly glow illuminated a firm chin, determined lips, and deep-set eyes that peered from a face so sooted he resembled a blackface minstrel. </p><p> Theodorus Hubbard, <i>Owanee's</i> engineer, wiped his hands on a twist of cotton and pitched it overhand into a bucket. He braced his diminutive frame against a massive door. It slowly gathered momentum, then slammed shut with an iron boom that traveled the length of the space, dying away along catwalks, pumps, copper-shining piping, gutta-percha hose, glass tube-gauges of foaming water the color of melted opals. He said in a Connecticut twang, -- Pappy, what I want to know is, how you let everything go to hell in just two weeks. </p><p> The burly man above him growled, -- Well, last I heard was they was going to jerk this heap o' junk out of her and install one of them new Isherwoods. Never thought to be takin' her back to sea. </p><p> -- Get them stokers on the rails. Watch the gauge when you cut in the crossover. Let's fire her up, see if she holds. </p><p> MacNail's shout echoed above the inhaling roar of fans and the slap of leather blower belts. Two huge men with Irish faces ran toward them, boots hammering the limber boards laid over bilges black with a slurry of coal dust, ash, and seawater. They seized fascines of kindling, heaved them into the furnace, and tossed bucketfuls of kerosene after. MacNail hastily seated twelve huge iron nuts on the man-cover from which Hubbard had emerged, then began torquing them down with a wrench as the stokers snatched shovels off iron clips and threw coal like men possessed, raising a fine choking dust of black anthracite. </p><p><br> Eli followed Claiborne down a shoulder-wide ladder into a low cabin that smelled of segar smoke, spar varnish, and the rotten-egg stench of sulphur fumigant. The lieutenant pointed to a chair. Eli aligned his cap on his knees and cleared his throat. -- Are you the master of this vessel? </p><p> -- The captain, you mean? No. I am the first lieutenant and executive officer. Just appointed as Captain Trezevant's second in command. </p><p> -- Might I see the captain? </p><p> -- He is not aboard at present. Nor would it be proper for me to intrude your presence upon him without ascertaining your business here, and that in considerable detail. </p><p> The lieutenant looked tired. Eli noticed he wore no sword, and began to doubt whether his own was not out of place. He nudged it around out of sight behind him as Claiborne said, -- Well, sir, let's have another look at those papers. </p><p> As he leafed through them, Eli found his glance arrested by two small gleaming eyes that stared back at him from a fiddle-boarded bookcase. In the dimness he gradually made out that they were set in a tiny wizened face. He stood to examine what he took for a stuffed curio, then put out a hand. And staggered back a moment later, gripping his finger and stifling a scream. </p><p> -- His name's Auguste, said Claiborne as the monkey hopped out, drawing a minuscule paw across its mouth and chattering angrily at the New Yorker. -- Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin, to give him his complete honors. We took him and a few of his compatriots aboard at Porto Praya. As the days passed they gradually grew fewer, but we were hard put to tell where they'd gone. Finally we discovered this fellow here was pitching the smaller ones overboard at night to watch them swim. </p><p> The animal leapt to the floor and scrabbled up the companionway. Claiborne turned the documents over, scanning each with every appearance of interest. Finally he cleared his throat. -- I hope you will not take it amiss if I observe I have never heard of the New York Naval Militia. </p><p> -- Not at all. Eli wrenched his mind away from the ape, how disturbingly its shadowy leer had parodied a human smile. -- It's a volunteer body, recently organized among the better sort of the city. Those who wish to step forward, should the slavocratic conspiracy put our temper to the test. </p><p> -- Should the what? </p><p> -- The renegade Carolinians who feel disposed to insult our flag. </p><p> Claiborne said gravely, -- You must pardon me; I have been absent the country, and am unfamiliar with the political cant of the moment. </p><p> -- You must know that the Deep South states have rejected all compromise, and set up a rump legislature at Montgomery. </p><p> -- I read the journals, sir; and as far as I know, no offer of concession has been tendered them as yet. But let us lay that difficult topic aside. Your purpose in visiting <i>Owanee?</i> </p><p> Eli felt steadily less comfortable. The gravely courteous officer before him was plainly from south of the Mason-Dixon. The fellow's eyes, too, were unsettling, the same pale bleached blue as the noon sky in August. -- I'm here to help in any way you may find convenient. I won't require pay. </p><p> -- No pay, eh? It's true we're shorthanded just now. Claiborne examined the letters again. -- These reflect attendance at Harvard University. What degree did you take? </p><p> -- I was permitted to withdraw after two years, for reasons of health. </p><p> -- You appear robust enough to me. </p><p> Eli said carefully, -- Just now I feel well. </p><p> -- Do you have anything resembling experience at sea? </p><p> -- My family's been in shipping for three generations. I've also spent some considerable time aboard Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt's private yacht. </p><p> Claiborne's eyebrows rose. -- I see. Aboard his private yacht. You know Mr. Vanderbilt intimately, I take it? </p><p> -- Not intimately, but well enough to speak to. </p><p> The exec mused over this for a moment more, then reached for a bell. -- Ask the bo's'n to step in, he said to Jerrett's apprehensive countenance. -- Your qualifications would not go so far as a mate's ticket, would they, Mr. Eaker? </p><p> -- I'm afraid not. I'm willing to learn, though. And as I said, I will be happy to serve without emolument. </p><p> A tap at the doorjamb, and the exec motioned in a spare, spry old warrant with a furrowed brow, bright black eyes, and a preposterous forked gray-and-tobacco beard that hung below his waist. Claiborne introduced him as Josiah Girnsolver, <i>Owanee's</i> boatswain. He told Girnsolver their visitor had alluded to experience in yachts, and that his qualifications as a sailing officer were under discussion. </p><p> The old man turned his head slowly to the left, then to the right, as if easing a stiff neck. He pulled up a trowser-leg, revealing the top of a prickly-looking red wool sock. Then said in a Down East accent, scratching his ankle thoughtfully, -- Wal, let's say the cap'n tells ya to furl sails. What d'ya say to carry that out, now, sor? </p><p> Eli cleared his throat, calling on Mnemosyne to assist him. -- To furl sails. Well, first I should call away the men. Um, then, command them to go aloft. </p><p> -- "Aloft t'gallant and royal yardmen?" Girnsolver suggested. </p><p> -- Quite so. When they have gained the rigging, get the topmen aloft; then man my clew jiggers -- </p><p> -- Buntlines and clew jiggers? </p><p> -- I was about to say, buntlines as well. When all men are in position, I tell them to furl away. Then when all is complete, to lay down from aloft, I suppose. </p><p> Claiborne prompted, -- And the downbooms? </p><p> -- I should tell them to lay in the downbooms. </p><p> They regarded him noncommittally. The warrant fingered his whistle, which hung from his neck on a lanyard of ornately embroidered marline. He said, -- Say ye're under way by the wind on a starboard tack, under all sail. What d'ya do if the wind hauls aft, as the officer of the deck? </p><p> Eli coughed into his fist, fighting both nervousness and the familiar rising tickle in his throat. -- Maintaining the same course? I should first ease off sheets. Get a pull of the braces. Man the halyards on deck, then haul taut and hoist away. And make sure, ah, make sure the boom, I forget the name of it, but make sure it's ready for coming back in. </p><p> Claiborne asked him, -- How many p...</p></p><h2>Strange Fruit</h2><p>A love-story vividly narrated, against a background of racial tension in a typical small Southern town</p><p>LILLIAN SMITH (1897-1966) was a writer, teacher, lecturer, and civil rights activist. Born in Florida, Smith spent much of her life in Georgia. She is the author of seven books, including <i>Killers of the Dream</i>, <i>Strange Fruit</i>, and <i>One Hour</i>, and was also the founding editor of the magazine <i>South Today</i>.It's August, it's hot, it's revival time in Maxwell, Georgia. Tracy Deen, the rebel child who always disappoints his self-sacrificing mother, returns home from World War I. It is clear as day, once he is able to put his feelings into words, that he loves Nonnie Anderson. But Tracy Deen is white and Nonnie Anderson isn't. She's from one of the best colored families in Maxwell, even college educated, but she isn't white; and now she's pregnant with Tracy's child and she's glad. Nonnie's brother and sister try to make Nonnie see the problems they all now face. Maxwell is a town where, on the surface, people know their place. But after a white man is murdered in the black part of town, fear takes over and a vigilante group soon appears. A young man laments: "Right now, I have some ideas...If I stay here twenty years, I won't have them. Now I see things without color getting in the way - I won't be able to, then. It'll get me. It gets us all. Like quicksand.

They looked like ordinary dead peasants. Yet for those who believed in them, they were terrifying. So terrifying that they prompted live burials, nervous breakdown, hysterical paralysis, and speechlessness. During a real vampire panic, an overworked, underfed community was so terrified that it found the energy to dig up 11 graves, and the wood to burn 11 corpses. Real vampires were so terrifying that the energy of fear they produced actually caused poltergeist attacks. In several cases, they were so terrifying that they quite literally scared people to death. From Russia to New England, from the Scottish borders to Crete, and from the Bronze Age to the days of <i>Twilight</i>, <i>The Real Vampires </i>takes the reader on an unforgettable tour of wonder, horror, and strangeness.</p><p><b>Richard Sugg </b>specializes in marginal, forgotten, or tabooed histories, as showcased in his previous writing on a variety of supernatural and unusual themes.'In a crisp, readable style, sprinkled with humor, Richard Sugg gives new life to a topic that a less adventurous writer might conclude had been drained of vitality through boundless repetition. Along the way, Sugg revokes shopworn stereotypes (vampires always drink blood) and uncovers striking materializations (poltergeist vampires). Based on solid scholarship, without jargon, Sugg's sweeping examination of authentic vampires--from the ancient Old World to historical New England--delves deep, delivering insights into primal intersections between nature and culture, physiology and psychology. Sugg animates terrifying linking phenomena, such as nightmares and sleep paralysis, with actual stories connected to concrete landscapes. Readers feel the vampire's terror from the inside out.'--Michael E.

He sees the world in a different way, and by so doing, allows us to see that same world and human behavior in different ways as well. Oh, sure, there have been countless detectives who have followed in his footsteps and who seem to rival his abilities. Just turn on the TV or browse the local bookshop and you&#x2019;ll find idiosyncratic super sleuths using forensics and reasoning to solve a whole host of crimes and misdeeds. <br><br>And yet no one rivals our dear, dear Holmes. Why does Sherlock reign, even more than a century later, as king? Can this mystery be solved? Unable to reach either Holmes or Watson (or Doyle for that matter, though we&#x2019;ve tried every medium we can think of), we&#x2019;ve been forced to gather our own team of investigators to practice their powers of observation and perception, to apply their own reasoning and methodologies to the task at hand. The results, I fear, have led us to a number of cases that must be solved first.<br><br>Is Holmes simply eccentric or a sociopath? s he human, a dog or something from the holodeck? Is he as dangerous on the page as he is in person? Wait does he even exist? For that matter, do you? (I fear several investigators have been forced to take a much needed holiday after wrestling with that one.)<br><br>What is the source of his faculty of observation and facility for deduction? Systematic training as Watson surmises? Genetic? Or is he just really lucky?<br><br>And is this whole logic thing compatible with emotions? Are Holmes and Watson good friends or soul mates? Just what is the nature of friendship? Do they complete each other or just get on each other&#x2019;s nerves? And why all the secrecy? Disguises? Deceptions?<br><br>The plot thickens. What is the essence of consciousness? Is the observable world subject to our intentions? Why does Holmes debunk mysticism when Doyle so readily embraces it? Why is Holmes our favorite drug user?<br><br>Our notebooks are filled with clues and, dare I say, answers. Is there more than one way to define the concept, justice? Is hope necessary in the world? Is boredom? Play? Can any <i>thing</i> really be understood? Objectively?<br><br>And just what is the last unresolved mystery involving Sherlock Holmes?

For busy practitioners, the lamrim gives a concise and easily graspable picture of the Buddhist path. Best-selling author Thubten Chodron has a unique ability to present these teachings. In this volume, she provides clear explanations of the stages of the path, while the audio tracks on the downloadable MP3 links contain guided meditations on each of the topics covered in the text. The meditation teachings of lamrim, says Buddhist teacher Thubten Chodron, are like ready-made clothes that are easy to wear: they're systematized so that we can wear them right away, so we can learn and practice them in an organized fashion. <i> </i> <br><br> <i>Lamrim</i> can be translated in various ways: "stages of the path," "steps on the path," or "gradual path."

These systematic teachings are the subject of this book and the accompanying downloadable audio. The lamrim presents a step-by-step method to tame the mind, and each person will find meaning and insight according to his or her level of understanding.

Beginning with the end of World War I (November 11, 1918) on through to the stock market crash on November 12, 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression, the author provides a well-written history of the times. Some of the events of the day included are: Al Capone and Prohibition, scandals surrounding then president Harding, growth of the automobile industry, the first radio, and the &#34;scandalous&#34; rise of skirt hemlines.Only Yesterday <p>Hailed as a classic even when it was first published in 1931, Only Yesterday remains one of the most vivid and precise accounts of the volatile stock market and the heady boom years of the 1920's. A vibrant social history that is unparalleled in scope and accuracy, it artfully depicts the rise of post - World War I prosperity, the catalytic incidents that led to the Crash of 1929, and the devastating economic decline that ensued&#x2014;all set before a colorful backdrop of flappers, Al Capone, the first radio, and the "scandalous" rise of skirt hemlines. Now, this mesmerizing chronicle is reintroduced to offer readers of today an unforgettable look at one of the most dynamic periods of America's past.</p> <p>With a novelist's eye for detail and a historian's attention to the facts, Frederick Lewis Allen tells a story that will ignite your imagination as its rich pageant of characters and events comes alive. Peppering his narrative with actual stock quotes and financial news, Allen tracks the major economic trends of the decade and explores the underlying causes of the Crash. Here are fresh accounts of Harding's oil scandals and the growth of the automobile industry, as well as the decline of the family farm, the Coolidge prosperity, and the long bull market of the late twenties. Allen's virtual hour-by-hour account of the Crash itself, told from multiple perspectives with mounting suspense, is as gripping as anything you are likely to read in fiction.</p> <p>In addition to his power as a storyteller, Allen was a living witness to the events he describes; there is a thrilling you-are-there feeling about the unfolding history. After a brief "return to normalcy" following the War, the pace of life in America quickly escalated to a full gallop. New forces were being unleashed: prosperity with serious inflation, larger-than-life figures such as J. Pierpont Morgan and Henry Ford, and the Big Red Scare of the early twenties. Allen documents the new inventions, fads, and scandals as they affected the daily life of the country, including the impact of Freud and Einstein, Prohibition and Al Capone, Babe Ruth and Jack Dempsey, the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti, and the shocking changes in manners and morals. In Only Yesterday we hear America talking to itself from coast to coast, furiously debating its own rapidly evolving destiny.</p> <p>An engaging narrative that describes the harried, often tumultuous events of Wall Street in the twenties, as well as the infectious spirit of the times, Only Yesterday is not only a compelling account of years gone by, but a true classic that will be appreciated for years to come.</p> <p>"When this fascinating social history of America in the 1920's was first published in 1931, the twenties were indeed Only Yesterday. But, as Mr. Allen makes clear, they were so much more than the clich&#x2014; would have it. . . . Frederick Allen's marvelous book brings back an exciting time in the life of the nation. I am quite sure you will enjoy reading it as much as Mr. Allen and I enjoyed living it." &#x2014;from the Foreword by Roy R. Neuberger.</p> <p>Recognized as a classic even when it was first published in 1931, Only Yesterday is a fascinating and revealing chronicle of the volatile stock market and heady boom years of the 1920's. Written by an esteemed historian who witnessed firsthand the explosive atmosphere and events of the time, this compelling narrative takes its place as one of the most important and invaluable contributions to investment literature.</p> <p>Acclaim for Only Yesterday</p> <p>"Marvelously absorbing . . .

Joanne Lauck says yes&#x2014;and challenges the reader to view six- and eight-legged beings as messengers, guides, initiatory figures, and friends. Drawing on myth, touching and funny anecdotes, Native American wisdom, and science, Lauck shows how we can live in harmony with insects, healing an inner aspect of ourselves in the process.</p><p>Key Note <p>In Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass, a gnat asks Alice, "What sort of insects do you rejoice in where you come from?" Puzzled by the question, she replies, "I don't rejoice in insects at all." In these lines an ancient world that honored all life forms meets our Western culture which ranks other species on a hierarchy of perceived value and places insects and related creatures at the bottom. There are reasons why we mistrust and fear insects. Few have much to do with the real creatures. Most involve misperceptions about them, ourselves, and our relationship to the Earth community-the roots of our enmity are embedded in a false creation story and a bid to overpower and control the natural world. </p><p>Major Selling Points </p><p>No matter what your age, environment, or standard of living, one must interact with the insect world, and most people spend enormous amounts of money trying to eradicate them. </p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that 84% of U.S. households still use pesticides in the home and millions of people store chemicals already banned. This book has an expanding market in those homeowners and parents who now realize that using chemicals is no longer an option. </p><p>This book gives readers the opportunity to expand their circle of concern and deepen their commitment to live in harmony with all other species. </p><p>The book has a ready audience with home-owners, environmentalists, organic gardeners and people working in animal-related fields, including pet owners. </p><p>It will also appeal to those people who are aware of the need to protect the natural world and who have gained an appreciation for other species, but cannot yet include insects because their appearances, appetites or numbers are threatening. </p><p>By investigating the reasons why we have, individually and collectively, adopted an adversarial and false stance toward creeping creatures, the reader learns that they have an innate affiliation for them. </p><p>With the current popularity of films such as Antz and A Bug's Life, public interest in the insect world is at an all-time high. These films try to make insects personable to children. This book makes insects sacred to adults. Working together, the films and the book will change attitudes towards insects in a positive way. </p><p>Marketing Plans Major review coverage National TV and radio campaign that will focus on the environment, health professionals and educators.

Drawing on myth, anecdote, native wisdom, and science, she reveals the roots of our hostility and shows us how to stop the war and live in harmony - healing an inner aspect of ourselves in the process.</p><h2>Cowgirl Rosie and Her Five Baby Bison</h2><p>Cowgirl Rosie and the sheriff venture into the desert to track down Rosie&#39;s missing baby bison.</p><p>Stephen Gulbis is a freelance illustrator who studied graphic design at Bath Academy of Art in England. He lives in Banbury, England, with his wife and their two daughters, Laura and Rosie. This is his first picture book.<p>PreS-Gr 2-In a leap of reason fit only for silly tall tales out of the Wild West, Cowgirl Rosie is responsible for the care of five baby bison-Bigwig, Bonnie, Beefy, Butch, and Baby B. As with any big family, the youngsters keep Rosie busy. On a trip into town to visit Sheriff Joe, one by one, the bison disappear. "Oh calamity!" With the help of the sheriff, the young protagonist searches high and low for her babies. The two meet up with Snakey Jake, who coincidentally has five white bison in a flour sack. It is only when Rosie's unhappy tears fall like rain upon the flour-covered animals that their true identities are uncovered. With her handy lasso, Rosie thwarts Jake's attempt at escape, and the happy cowgirl is a local hero. For her reward, Sheriff Joe gives her a brand-new five-bison baby buggy. The hilarious language and predictability of this tale make it a fun choice to read aloud. The pace of the story is quick, and the vibrant illustrations convey not only the campy silliness of the story, but also incorporate traditional images of the West. A fun-filled addition to any group read-aloud, though certainly enjoyable one-on-one as well.-Piper L.

Within five years it had sold nearly half a million copies in various editions, and was added to the prestigious Modern Library. The actor Ray Milland, who would win an Oscar for his portrayal of Birnam, was coached in the ways of drunkenness by the novel&#x2019;s author&#x2014;a balding, impeccably groomed middle-aged man who had been sober since 1936 and had no intention of going down in history as the author of a thinly veiled autobiography about a crypto-homosexual drunk. But<i> The Lost Weekend</i> was all but entirely based on Jackson&#x2019;s own experiences, and Jackson&#x2019;s valiant struggles fill these pages. He and his handsome gay brother, Fred (&#x201c;Boom&#x201d;), grew up in the scandal-plagued village of Newark, New York, and later lived in Europe as TB patients, consorting with aristocratic caf� society. Jackson went on to work in radio and Hollywood, was published widely, lived in the Hotel Chelsea in New York City, and knew everyone from Judy Garland and Billy Wilder to Thomas Mann and Mary McCarthy. A doting family man with two daughters, Jackson was often industrious and sober; he even became a celebrated spokesman for Alcoholics Anonymous. Yet he ultimately found it nearly impossible to write without the stimulus of pills or alcohol and felt his devotion to his work was worth the price. Rich with incident and character, <i>Farther &amp; Wilder</i> is the moving story of an artist whose commitment to bringing forbidden subjects into the popular discourse was far ahead of his time.</p></p><p><p>Blake Bailey is the author of <i>A Tragic Honesty: The Life and Work of Richard Yates</i>, a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, and <i>Cheever: A Life</i>, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Francis Parkman Prize, and a finalist for the Pulitzer and James Tait Black Memorial Prizes.&nbsp; He edited a two-volume edition of Cheever&#x2019;s work for the Library of America, and in 2010 received an Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.&nbsp; He lives in Virginia with his wife and daughter.<br></p>Chapter One<br><br>Et in Arcadia Ego<br><br>On November 12, 1916, when Charles Jackson was thirteen, his sixteen-year-old sister, Thelma, and four-year-old brother, Richard, were killed during a Sunday drive with friends, when an express train hit their Overland automobile at a pump-station crossing. Next morning The New York Times reported that the two young people in the front seat, Harold Scarth and Gladys Clark, were likely to survive, but that Gladys&#x2019;s brother Malbie had &#x201c;probably&#x201d; suffered fatal injuries. Indeed, the boy&#x2019;s back had been broken and he&#x2019;d died &#x201c;in terrible agony&#x201d; a few hours after the collision.<br><br>One learned of Malbie&#x2019;s fate in the much fuller account given five days later in the Union-Gazette, one of two weekly newspapers in the victims&#x2019; hometown of Newark, a small village (pop. 6,200) in the township of Arcadia, thirty miles east of Rochester and fifty miles west of Syracuse. &#x201c;three killed in fatal automobile accident,&#x201d; read the redundant headline spanning four front-page columns: &#x201c;Newark Party of Young People Struck by Sunday Empire State Express&#x2014;Village in Sadness Over the Calamity&#x2014;Accident at East Palmyra&#x2014;The Funerals.&#x201d; Particular attention was paid to Thelma Jackson, who was not only &#x201c;one of the most beautiful young ladies in the village,&#x201d; but &#x201c;winsome&#x201d; and &#x201c;sunny,&#x201d; too&#x2014;so much so that her mother had often worried about her parlous attractiveness to men, especially older men such as their next-door neighbor on Prospect Street, a notorious reprobate named Barney. Ever since Thelma was twelve (as Charlie would later recall in semi-fictional form), the man had made a habit of undressing in front of his window, with the lights on, for the benefit of the pretty girl whose bedroom was opposite his. But Thelma was nothing if not spirited, and when Barney began (on warm summer nights) to wander across the lawn in his BVDs, peeping into windows, Thelma dumped a pail of water on his head from her upstairs window.<br><br>The four-year-old Richard (also described as &#x201c;winsome&#x201d; by the Union-Gazette) was devoted to his older sister, and had begun to cry when her friends arrived that Sunday afternoon to take her on a drive to nearby Palmyra. Thelma had a date with Harold, the driver, and Richard would have been a fifth wheel; nevertheless, a few minutes after leaving, Thelma insisted her friends turn the car around to retrieve her little brother. As the Union-Gazette characterized that fateful decision: &#x201c;In their life, they had spent hours in play and enjoyment and it seemed almost as if Heaven had decreed that in their death they should not be divided.&#x201d;<br><br>Harold let Gladys drive on the way home, though she was relatively inexperienced. A freight train was standing to the right at East Palmyra Pump Station, obscuring the approach of the Empire State Express, and when Gladys pulled onto the tracks the car was struck in the rear. All five passengers were thrown clear and lay scattered about while the train went roaring past. Harold, uninjured save for a few scratches, &#x201c;proved to be a hero and master of the situation,&#x201d; as the Union-Gazette reported: &#x201c;He first picked up Miss Gladys Clark who was not seriously injured, but who was screaming frantically, &#x2018;Where is Jim,&#x2019; Jim being a pet family name for Malbie Clark, her brother.&#x201d; Harold found the others some forty feet away on the Ganargua River bridge: Richard was dead, but Thelma&#x2014;who&#x2019;d sat on the near side of the backseat and borne the brunt of the impact&#x2014;was still breathing, her face bruised on one side; when Harold lifted her, though, he saw she was &#x201c;terribly mutilated,&#x201d; her lower trunk crushed.<br><br>Meanwhile her brother Charlie was at the library, where he spent most weekend afternoons while other boys his age were playing baseball near the paper mill or sitting quietly on front porches in their Sunday best. The handsome Rew Memorial Library was cause for considerable civic pride, containing almost twelve thousand volumes and presided over by a trained librarian, the formidable Miss Merriman; ladies gathered downstairs for weekly meetings of the Shakespeare Club, the Coterie Club, and the Browning Club, while Nellie Reamer sat at a corner table, day after day, transcribing every word of the King James Bible. As for Charlie, he especially loved the exotic souvenirs lined up around the top of the bookshelves on the main floor&#x2014;the fruits of founder Henry C. Rew&#x2019;s travels all over the world: a grass skirt, an Orinoco witch doctor&#x2019;s mask, a three-foot totem pole, and (Charlie&#x2019;s favorite) an alabaster model of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Near the exit was a large globe that boys would spin on their way out, pointing their fingers tensely near the surface and telling themselves, &#x201c;Where the globe stops, the spot where my finger is pointing at&#x2014;that&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;m going to die.&#x201d; At least once, Charlie had discovered (&#x201c;to his horror&#x201d;) that he would die in his own home state.<br><br>The boy was reading his favorite book&#x2014;The Red Feathers (1907), by Theodore Goodrich Roberts, about Indians in Newfoundland&#x2014;when Miss Merriman told him she&#x2019;d gotten a telephone call and that Charlie needed to go home right away. Rather ominously, she added that he could keep The Red Feathers for good. Turning onto Prospect Street he was hailed by a neighbor, Win Burgess, an affable man who wrote a gag column for the Newark Courier (sample item: &#x201c;A minister&#x2019;s son was run down and killed by an automobile in Brooklyn, the other day. You can get most anything on a minister&#x2019;s son&#x201d;). Burgess had tears in his eyes, and the front hall of his house was crowded with weeping neighbors. Sitting at the kitchen table, alone, was Charlie&#x2019;s oldest brother, Herb, sobbing so loudly that Charlie felt embarrassed for him. Burgess explained that Richard and Thelma had been hurt in an accident&#x2014;nobody knew how badly (&#x201c;the car was completely smashed, they tell me&#x201d;)&#x2014;and their mother had gone to Palmyra; Charlie and his brothers, Herb and Fred, would be staying at the Burgesses&#x2019; for the time being.<br><br>The Jackson family had already been under a strain, since the father had taken a job as paymaster at the T. A. Gillespie Shell Loading Plant in New Jersey, and was now living almost full time in Manhattan. The village buzzed with rumors of divorce, an awful disgrace among nice people. &#x201c;No, no, there&#x2019;s nothing wrong&#x2014;&#x201d; Win Burgess was saying over the telephone, while urging Charlie&#x2019;s father to catch a train back to Newark. The latter was not, apparently, deceived. &#x201c;Mr. Jackson in New York,&#x201d; read a subheading in the Union-Gazette, which proceeded to relate a strange encounter at Grand Central Terminal between Fred Jackson and the conductor of the Empire State Express: &#x201c;The conductor began to talk, not knowing Mr. Jackson, and said he had been having a dreadful experience all the way down, as his train had struck at East Palmyra an automobile containing a number of young people, two of whom had been killed outright and the third of whom would probably die. Mr. Jackson informed him that the two that he had killed were his own children and the conductor fairly quailed.&#x201d; On meeting his family in Newark, Fred Jackson promptly declared that he would sue the New York Central for &#x201c;a good ten thousand at least,&#x201d; then began to cry in a way that struck Charlie as &#x201c;somehow cheap, or at least false.&#x201d;<br><br>This was a retrospective judgment. In later years, Jackson would dismiss his father as a &#x201c;trivial, vain man&#x201d; who had no business raising children in the first place. Charlie remembered how his father (&#x201c;nostrils distended&#x201d;) would unfailingly pinch the bottoms of Thelma&#x2019;s friends, or otherwise contrive to grope them, until she stopped bringing them home altogether. When he took the job in New Jersey, and his absences became longer and longer, the vulturous Mrs. Van Benschoten would coax Charlie into her house with a cookie and cross-question him: Why is Mr. Jackson away from home so much? Is he coming home for Thanksgiving? Is he coming for Christmas? Such neighbors were also careful to let the boy know, with a word here and there, that they were hardly alone in suspecting his father of scandalous behavior. But Charlie and his father were a pair: not only did they look the same (in Fred&#x2019;s childhood photos, he might have passed for his middle son&#x2019;s twin), but even in later years Charlie would concede, dismally, that his father and he were fundamentally alike. &#x201c;You even blow your nose like your father!&#x201d; his mother had accused him, sobbing, during an argument (though her mixed feelings were such that she enjoyed Ronald Colman movies, because the actor reminded her of both Charlie and her errant husband).<br><br>The fact was, Fred Jackson had shown a particular interest in the child he most resembled, avidly reading the boy&#x2019;s poetry and giving him the cardboards from his laundered shirts to draw pictures on. &#x201c;Papa was proud&#x201d; of his poems and pictures, the son remembered, and &#x201c;showed them to the neighbors, complimented me, and himself sent them off to the Children&#x2019;s Page of the New York Sunday World. . . . He used to buy fifteen or twenty copies of the Sunday World when one of my poems appeared in it, cut them out, sent them to relatives . . .&#x201d; Once his father had gone, however, Charlie lost interest in writing and drawing for a while, and whatever praise he later got was never enough, since the person he most wanted to please had long ceased to pay attention. Perhaps the blackest day of his childhood&#x2014;among many black days&#x2014;was the day his mother received a letter from Fred definitely announcing he wasn&#x2019;t coming home anymore. In The Lost Weekend, Don Birnam remembers how he &#x201c;had run upstairs then and flung himself down on the bed and cried his eyes out&#x201d;: &#x201c;How could your admiring father do that to you, go away and leave you forever, did he really not care for you any more, was it possible? And though he sobbed and sobbed on the bed in shame and anguish, he realized too the awful importance of that letter, and he glanced up into the mirror of the bureau to see what a moment of crisis looked like.&#x201d;<br><br>that ghastly year&#x2014;the year of his siblings&#x2019; death and his father&#x2019;s desertion&#x2014;Charlie had missed eighty days of school, though he was eager to return and be noticed as a tragic hero of sorts. He&#x2019;d practiced the role with more long looks in the mirror, and besides, he&#x2019;d gotten used to a certain amount of attention as a little boy who often seemed almost a prodigy, or at any rate eager to please. &#x201c;At school Jackson stood invariably at the head of his class,&#x201d; a journalist later wrote, reflecting Jackson&#x2019;s own wistfulness on the subject. After all, his beloved second-grade teacher, Miss Anna Dalton, had been moved to write a letter on the occasion of his eighth birthday, congratulating Mrs. Jackson for having such a &#x201c;perfect child,&#x201d; or almost: on his report card that year he got straight A&#x2019;s except for a single B in writing, oddly enough.<br><br>Since then his grades had steadily declined, perhaps because Miss Dalton was no longer his immediate audience. Instead he ran home (avoiding baseball) and wrote those stories and poems for his father&#x2014;until, at last, he mostly occupied his solitude with reading about Indians and concocting elaborate fantasies that he would someday, perhaps, commit to paper. The year he turned eleven was consumed by an incipient romance titled &#x201c;The Story of Strongheart, an Indian Brave,&#x201d; which he talked (versus wrote) about incessantly; almost every day he&#x2019;d regale his exasperated mother with another Strongheart yarn, then rush upstairs and write in big, ornate letters on a fresh page of his notebook: &#x201c;the story of strongheart, an indian brave, By Charles Jackson, Aged Eleven (11).&#x201d; He was so obsessed with the subject that a neighbor, Mrs. Coykendall, warned him that he might turn into an Indian if he kept going on like that. &#x201c;I am already,&#x201d; Charlie lied. &#x201c;My uncle is an Indian.&#x201d; This became a signature episode of his childhood. From then on, whenever he told a story that seemed the least bit fanciful, his family was apt to remark, &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s just another one of your Indian uncles.&#x201d; (En route to Hollywood aboard the Super Chief in 1944, he spotted an ersatz Indian hawking souvenirs in the club car. &#x201c;He pretended not to recognize his nephew,&#x201d; Charlie wrote his brother Fred, &#x201c;but I knew he knew.&#x201d;) As he later summarized this epoch, &#x201c;These, then, were the things which occupied me, not only . . . after school, but all day long too in the classroom: a never-ending daydream that made me deficient in my studies, a stranger to my classmates, a nuisance to my mother, and forever restless and dissatisfied with myself.&#x201d;<br><br>Things took a turn for the better when Charlie, age twelve, discovered Shakespeare, which would lead, in time, to a voracious idolatry of Whitman, Melville, James, Mann, the great Russians, of Mozart and Beethoven and Mussorgsky, of Courbet and Monet and Goya&#x2014;a cultivation that was all the richer for being self-imposed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just a fan,&#x201d; said Jackson, happily admitting his lack of formal education. &#x201c;But a fan to my fingertips!&#x201d; Still, his greatest love would forever be Shakespeare, whose likeness was featured on his bookplate (&#x201c;ex libris / c. r. jackson&#x201d;), the better for friends to notice the startling resemblance between Charlie and Bard, what with the noble forehead, long nose, and little mustache. &#x201c;Can you do this sort of thing at the drop of any reasonably sized hat, Mr. Jackson?&#x201d; said an astonished Clifton Fadiman&#x2014;host of the popular radio show Information, Please!&#x2014;when his guest had demonstrated, yet again, an all but infallible knack for completing any Shakespeare quotation given a key word or two. It became a kind of compulsion, in life as in art. Don Birnam (named for the &#x201c;Great Birnam Wood&#x201d; in Macbeth) drowns in the Bard&#x2019;s poetry almost as much as in drink, musing that any novel he ever managed to write would be &#x201c;so packed with Shakespeare that it [would look] as if he worked with a concordance in his lap . . .&#x201d;<br><br>But this was a charming mania in a child, at least to the ladies of the Newark Shakespeare Club, who made a point of taking Charlie along to lectures given by an expert at the annual Chautauqua&#x2014;a weeklong event that Jackson would (for the most part) remember fondly, as it brought the great world of culture to an otherwise benighted place: concerts, a Broadway show, a Shakespearean comedy by the Ben Greet Players, and lectures by world-renowned luminaries such as William Jennings Bryan, Thomas Mott Osborne, and (as Jackson put it) &#x201c;whoever it was who was the author of a famous lecture called &#x2018;Acres of Diamonds&#x2019; (the diamonds were to be found in our own backyard, of course, if we&#x2019;d only look).&#x201d; The young Charlie would have no part of the insipid Children&#x2019;s Program, even if he hadn&#x2019;t been taken up by the Shakespeare Club, whose president (Mrs. Coykendall again) hustled him up to the dais when the lecturer had finished and announced that here was a child &#x201c;who reads Shakespeare like other boys read Tom Swift!&#x201d; &#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; said the man, and asked Charlie to name his favorite play. &#x201c;Tempest,&#x201d; said the latter without thinking, and the expert looked pleased: &#x201c;Now you&#x2019;re talking, young man!&#x201d; As an adult, Jackson was relieved (if a bit puzzled) to learn that there was, in fact, a real consensus as to the supremacy of The Tempest&#x2014;but on the whole the memory rankled. &#x201c;I shudder to think what a horrible child I must have been,&#x201d; he wrote the novelist Mary McCarthy, recounting his Chautauqua triumph thirty years later.</p><h2>Bloodstoppers and Bearwalkers: Folk Traditions of the Upper Peninsula</h2><p><p>Folklore as it comes from the mouths of living storytellers has a matchless authority and conviction. Richard Dorson, living for five months among the Indians, Finns, Canadiens, Cornishmen, lumberjacks, sailors, miners, and sagamen of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, has listened to their tales, which this book reproduces with all their native thunder and salt. With this lively evidence he proves that America still has its myth-makers and purveyors of myth, who represent, both ethnically and historically, an enormous range of traditional oral folklore.</p><p>We meet the Chippewa and Potawatomi Indians, who tell their own heroic versions of the wars with the white men, and whose chief delight is to relate the adventures of the folk hero, Winabijou. For them, as for the French-Canadians and Finns, magical beliefs have been part of their daily education and entertainment. Each group has its own version of European folk tales: the old fairy stories find new form as dragons are conquered with razors and soap, and giants talk in the idiom of the backwoods and pioneer towns.</p><p>Some of these myths center around imaginary and semi-imaginary folk heroes; others spring from local politics, and even more from local occupations. The woods tales of lumberjacks, the tragic mysteries of the mines, the weird adventures on the Lakes, each kind of tale has its representative teller. Sometimes the raconteur's most exciting fables concern his own wonderful exploits&#x2015;with women, drink, and wicked employers. Rooted deep in storytelling tradition, these tales hark back to the frontier and immigrant past of an America shaped by many peoples with extraordinary experiences.</p><p>Mr. Dorson provides, in his introduction, a simple account of the idea behind the book and his methods of procuring the tales, in concise and closely written notes at the end of the book he furnishes annotations to the tales which should satisfy and stimulate every folklorist, professional or otherwise. Mr. Dorson did much of the fieldwork for this book under a Library of Congress Fellowship; he has also held a Harvard Sheldon Traveling Fellowship, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and a Faculty Study Fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies.</p></p><p>Richard M. Dorson is Associate Professor of History at Michigan State University and review editor of the <i>Journal of American Folklore</i>.This is the sort of book that folklore scholars have yearned for, but seldom have been able to produce...Selecting from overflowing notebooks, the author has brought together a collection of traditions, tales, superstitions, practices, and folk biographies that range from the slyly humorous to the bawdy, and from the briskly energetic to the appallingly vicious frenzies of berserk men and mobs. These are human beings, a folk, not sitting for a portrait, but caught alive as it were in fine amber, a permanent possession. The beautiful, coarse and ugly are co&#x2013;mingled as in life; the one repels, the other attracts&#x2015;the result is a fascinated reader.

Filming took place over a 10-month period, exposing the crew to every extreme of climate. Most trying, physically, was constant sunlight at the Bikada Reserve far above the Arctic Circle, where they went to see musk oxen. At Repetek, near the Afghanistan border, temperatures were above 100; there in the desert, rangers patrol the reserve on camels. In the Ukraine, one of the last areas of virgin steppe is preserved; it is home to exotic and endangered grazing animals. The authors experienced fabulous hospitality and eager cooperation during their trip. They admire the work being done to protect wildlife, but note that there is no coordination among the reserves, no exchange of information.

He lives in Tucson, Arizona.<p>Greg is also a copyeditor. He is currently copyediting the "Arizona Breeding Bird Atlas" edited by Troy Corman, et. al.</p>Arizona's Gila River and its tributaries once formed the most important water system in the Southwest. Today, it has been bled dry; its wildlife and vegetation have been mostly destroyed and the lower river is on the EPA Superfund cleanup roster. McNamee ( Named in Stone: An Arizona Anthology ) reviews the geology and history of the Gila and chronicles its decline in a sad, familiar story of human impact on Western lands. Mining operations stripped mountains, diverted rivers and chewed up forests. Large-scale ranching, inappropriate agriculture, dams and profligate use of water have added to the river's demise. McNamee charges that Phoenix has the highest rate of water consumption in the nation, at one-fourth the cost of water in New York City; golf courses use up to one million gallons a day. To restore the river, he calls for reforesting the highlands, appropriate agriculture, removal of the dams and new federal policies. This is important reading for environmentalists.

In this volume, which accompanies an exhibition of the same name, Conisbee, Mus�e de Granet director Coutagne and others explore the painter's relationship with the region in exhaustive detail, offering insight into his methods and motivations. C�zanne eschewed scenes of the region's modernization for scenes of classical evocation and timelessness, and his choice to paint en pleine air was inspired not just by his mentor, the Impressionist Camille Pisarro, but also by an intense desire for isolation. "Isolation, that's what I deserve." he wrote. "At least that way, no one can get their hooks into me." His sojourns in the fishing village L'Estaque marked a turning point-as did his father's death, which freed the artist from the burdens of paternal disapproval. The plates and illustrations offer a remarkable overview of the various Provencal locales C�zanne repeatedly painted: Mount Saint-Victoire, L'Estaque, his father's home (the Jas de Bouffan) and additional sites in the region, allowing the reader to chart C�zanne's development of a technique that "makes it seem as though the paint itself is radiating light." A stellar record of the painter's life and work, this book is a must-have for art enthusiasts. 170 pages of color plates, 145 color and 30 black and white photographs.<br></p><p></p><h2>HUMAN SYSTEMS INTERACTIONS FOSS SCIENCE RESOURCES</h2><p>In the Human Systems Interactions Course, students tackle big questions about body systems and the environmental factors that affect them.

Jessica has so many regrets. She should have stopped pouring after that first glass of wine last night. Shouldn't have watched the ceiling swirl for hours. Should have resorted to a narcotic sleep aid sooner. Shouldn't have hit the snooze button one, two, three times before rocketing ("I'm late!") out of bed this morning. Should have skipped the shower, not breakfast. Shouldn't have turned down her dad's offer to drive her to the airport instead of proving her mother right about the unpunctual local car service. Should have chosen the security screening line to the right, not the left, not the one that put her directly behind the starving and savage middle-aged trafficker of more than three ounces of the liquid weight-loss supplement with the funny name, a name Jessica keeps repeating in her head in rhythm with her sneakered feet sprinting across Concourse C.<br><br>Hoodia. Hoodia. Hoodia.<br><br>So many split decisions and judgment calls and incorrect esti?mations have led to this. To being late. She's late late late late for Gate C-88. She likes the rhyme, especially when timed with the beat of her feet, and chooses this staccato incantation over the silly-sounding appetite suppressant.<br><br>I'm late late late late for Gate C-88.<br><br>She recalls how she used to silently mouth spur-of-the-moment mantras back in her competitive high school running days. Hand-slapping rhymes from her youth: Miss Mary Mack Mack Mack . . . All dressed in black, black, black. Boy-band lyrics she would never say out loud: You might hate me but it ain't no lie . . . Baby, bye, bye, bye. Even her own name: Jessica Darling . . . Darling . . . Darling . . . Jessica Darling . . . Darling . . . Darling. These invocations lacked deep meaning-even the song of herself-and were meant only to distract her from how much she hated having to pretend she cared about the outcome of the race.<br><br>Today she cares. And no matter how fast she sprints through this airport, there are too many people standing still. Standing in her way. Or stretched across the floor in carefree repose, smudgy fingertips plucking chips and curls and twists out of the bags of overpriced snacks in their laps. Seemingly in no hurry to get anywhere, which is funny if you think about it (but Jessica doesn't have time to think about it), because this is the place where passengers pass time until they can be jet-propelled across states and nations, oceans and continents, at six hundred miles per hour. Why are they standing still, standing in the way of where she needs to be? Surrounded on all sides by the drone of wheeled luggage buzzing across the concourse, she speeds up, slows down, stutter-steps, and shimmies her way through the hive. Onward, onward, onward. She was wide-awake, wild-eyed with worry, for most of the night, and this adrenalized marathon sprint is already taking its toll. She can feel fatigue settling into her muscles, her bones, her brain, her spirit. But no. No! She can't slow down now. She can't miss this flight. I can't miss this flight. The concourse splits down the middle, and she must quickly consider yet another option. Should she hop on the human conveyor belt or just keep running?<br><br>There is pure goodness awaiting her in the Virgin Islands. Her best friends are all together to "celebrate the rarest love between two people, the flawed yet fearless union that everyone hopes to find but almost always turns out to be illusive if not elusive." (Quotation marks needed because it comes directly from the speech Jessica has prepared for the occasion.) Jessica knows her friends will forgive her if she misses this flight-as they have forgiven so many of her unintentional slights and oversights-but she won't forgive herself.<br><br>I can't miss this flight, she silently says once more before choosing to trust her own two feet over technology, the last in a series of synchronistic decisions that contribute to everything that happens afterward.<br><br>three<br><br>"This is a final boarding call for passenger Jessica Darling."<br><br>After Marcus hears it the first time, he makes sure to listen extra carefully the second time, just to confirm it is her name being called over the public address system and not a phantom echo in his mind.<br><br>"This is a final boarding call for Clear Sky Flight 1884 with nonstop service to St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. Final boarding call for passenger Jessica Darling."<br><br>Jessica Darling. It's been years since he's heard her full name spoken out loud. Not that Jessica Darling hasn't been analyzed, assailed, or alluded to in conversations with family, friends, and near strangers from their shared past. As a subject of discussion, Jessica Darling has been elevated by-not reduced to-pronoun status. Have you seen her? What's she up to these days? Whenever anyone asks these questions, there's never any doubt as to whom the "her" or "she" refers. But those questions haven't been asked lately, not since Marcus has-by all actions and outward appearances-finally gotten over her.<br><br>Even after hearing her name once, now twice, Marcus still needs a confirmation from somewhere outside his imagination. He seizes his friend Natty by the lapels and asks.<br><br>"Dude, no," Natty insists. "I didn't hear her name. And neither did you." Natty's sharp tone can't burst the pop-eyed, expectant expression on Marcus's face. "And even if you did hear her name, there's no way it's her. Now let go of me, because I gotta take a piss."<br><br>Natty strands Marcus between the entrance to the men's restroom and the fiberglass Betty Boop sculpture boop-boop-be-beckoning customers into the faux-retro Garden State Diner for a greasy preflight meal. Marcus feels overexposed, overstimulated, as if his whole body is on extrasensory alert. Marcus's nerves rattle and clang like the dirty silverware carelessly thrown into plastic takeaway tubs by the too- busy busboys. He tries to calm himself with a series of deep inhalations and exhalations, but breathing cheeseburger smog only makes him more queasy and ill at ease. The alarms going off in his nervous system evoke the erratic animal behavior that precedes natural disasters: a mass exodus of elephants seeking higher ground, dogs wailing under door frames, rabbits clawing at cages, snakes shaken from hibernation slithering through the snow. His instincts, too, urge him to flee. He half jogs away from the diner and heads for the blue- screened monitors announcing arrivals and departures.<br><br>As Marcus searches for Clear Sky Flight 1884 on the departures board, he makes an effort to accept Natty's logic. After all, didn't his Jessica Darling often joke about being confused with a porn star also named Jessica Darling? Perhaps it's the X-rated Jessica Darling being called over the public address system, or maybe even a third unknown Jessica Darling who shares nothing but a name with the other two. A newborn Jessica Darling. A granny Jessica Darling. An African- American, Asian, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, or Other Jessica Darling. It must be one of these alternative Jessica Darlings flying out to St. Thomas on Clear Sky Flight 1884, not his Jessica Darling, not the one he proposed to over three years ago, not the one he hasn't seen, spoken to, or otherwise communicated with since he quietly accepted that her answer was no.<br><br>He's found it: Gate C-88. Clear Sky Flight 1884 to St. Thomas is departing from Gate C-88.<br><br>What harm could there be in wandering over to Gate C-88 to see for himself which incarnation of Jessica Darling is being called out loud? None at all, save for the minor embarrassment of being suckered into a one in six billion long shot. But what if it turns out that the familiar name does belong to her familiar face? Marcus is incapable of calculating the risks of such an improbable outcome. Still, he knows himself well enough to understand how the powers of his masochistic imagination would make the coward's alternative-never knowing, always wondering was it her? was it her? was it her?-a far greater punishment than any awkward small talk.<br><br>He looks away from the monitors because the orange font/blue screen makes his pupils vibrate. On the wall directly in front of him is<br><br>a changing digital screen advertisement for the Shops at Newark Liberty International Airport. Before he even realizes he's doing it, Marcus impassively watches the images shift.<br><br>The picture: A gold-foil box of gourmet chocolates.<br><br>The words: missing her.<br><br>The picture: A string of black South Sea pearls.<br><br>The words: missing her like crazy.<br><br>Marcus, wowed by the lack of subtlety, looks away and laughs at himself.<br><br>No. He can't give in to narcissistic folly and read this sign as a Sign. It's taken him three years to finally pull himself together, and he refuses to come undone by commonplace coincidence. In fact, he's just about convinced himself that Natty is right, that there's no way it was his Jessica Darling being summoned over the Clear Sky PA system, that there's no need to head to Gate C-88 to verify this impossibility for himself because it is not, it cannot be, her, not his Jessica Darling (why does his skin still prickle with premonitory anticipation?), when his Jessica Darling slams right into him and bounces onto the floor.<br><br>four<br><br>A body in motion. A body at rest. Forces coming together-CRASH!-in an instant. Energy spent, energy exchanged, and energy conserved. Jutting elbows, bared teeth. Elastic arms, slack mouths. To every action there is an equal but opposite reaction. This woman and this man, a living demonstration of Newton's Third Law.<br><br>five<br><br>Jessica curses herself as she scrambles across the marble tiles. Clad in head-to-toe black, she resembles a desperate beetle stuck on its back, arms and legs flailing for her flung-to-the-ground carry-on bag. She finds it, scrapes herself off the floor, and decides that a curt give-and-take of apologies is the path of least resistance, the quickest way to get past this stranger, this nuisance, this object of interference with feet stuffed into scuffed Vans. There are already too many eyes on them, watching, wondering what will happen next. A combative confrontation will only attract more rubberneckers, and she doesn't want anyone else slowing her down.<br><br>Marcus waits until she stands up before he takes a chance. "Jessica?"<br><br>It's the voice that reaches her first, not the correct first name uttered by the voice. Her head bolts up, and when her eyes corroborate with her ears, her breath catches and her hands fly up to her face. She breathes in and out through her palms, once, twice, before taking them away. Miraculously, he's still there. She is perfectly still for the first time since vaulting out of bed this morning.<br><br>"Marcus!"<br><br>He nods to confirm what should be obvious but is still too unbelievable.<br><br>"Marcus," she repeats, softer.<br><br>He nods again.<br><br>"I . . ." she begins. "I'm . . ."<br><br>They are standing inches apart, not touching. Jessica clutches her ergonomic teardrop-shaped carry-on bag to her chest, sensing that the moment to embrace has passed. A spontaneous show of emotion now would be too conspicuous, too much, too late.<br><br>"Late!" Jessica blurts. "I'm too late."<br><br>Hundreds of passengers swirl around and away from them, like so many snowflakes in a blizzard.<br><br>"Oh," Marcus says. He's contemplating whether he could get away with playfully swatting her arm in what he hopes is a neutral zone, between her shoulder and elbow. Behind her flashes the sign. The<br><br>gold-foil box of gourmet chocolates. missing her. The string of black South Sea pearls. missing her like crazy. The sign. The Sign. He wants to make contact when he makes his confession, that he'd heard her name, and how he had hoped for the illogical, the impossible, to be true: that it was really her. And today of all days. He's about to touch her, then deliver the befitting wishes, when she casts a nervous sidelong glance at his turned-out palm, the part of him that dares to come too close. He drops the offending hand and stuffs it deep into the front pocket of his corduroys, knowing there's no time for such intimacies.<br><br>He says nothing.<br><br>"We should-" Jessica starts. She's rocking from side to side now, an anxious, joyless dance. "You should-" The pronoun change doesn't go unnoticed by either of them. "E-mail. Or, I don't know. Text. Something . . ."<br><br>"Something," he says simply.<br><br>Marcus musters the courage to look Jessica right in the face. She still wears her hair like an afterthought, pulled back with a few quick twists of a rubber band. If she removed the elastic and shook it out, he would breathe in the fruity scent of shampoo, certain that the chestnut tresses resting against her neck are still damp from her morning shower. He finds some comfort in this knowledge, as well as in the overall familiarity of her features, which haven't changed that much since he last saw her. But he must admit to himself-only to himself, never to her, even if she'd had the time or the temerity to ask-that her casual loveliness is more than a little washed-out. Her eyes are tired, tinged pink, and buffered by puffy purple undereye circles. Her lips are crackled dry, her nostrils chapped and flaking around the corners, perhaps from too many rubs with a paper towel, a wool coat sleeve, or some other rough tissue substitute. He hopes that her careworn appearance is an aberration, that her immune system is down but she's not. He wants her to be sick or tired, but not sick and tired, or just plain sad.<br><br>"I'd catch up if . . ." Her cheeks glow an embarrassed red, and her pale complexion is better for it.<br><br>"If you had time," Marcus finishes for her, trying to determine from her voice whether she's suffering from a cold or something worse.<br><br>"If-" she starts again, but doesn't finish.<br><br>She can't look up at him. If she looks up at him, she will see him. And if she sees him, she'll be compelled to ask questions she doesn't have time for. Instead, she concentrates on her own familiar Converses, but even that fails to bring her relief. That they both still wear their same favorite brands of sneakers after all these years is only a minor revelation, and yet even this tiny glimpse of his world going on without her-and hers without him-is almost too much for Jessica to bear. What else hasn't changed? Does he still meditate for hours on the floor of his closet? Jessica braces herself with a deep breath. Would he still smell like smoldering leaves if she leaned in close enough? Does he still compose elliptical, poetic songs on his acoustic guitar?<br><br>Derelict lyrics force themselves to the front of her consciousness, a ballad softly sung when they were still teenagers, the only one Marcus ever wrote or sang for her:<br><br>I confess, yes, our fall was all my fault<br><br>If you kissed my eyes, your lips would taste salt . . .<br><br>Her watery eyes stay fixed on the unraveled seams splitting his mossy V-neck a quarter inch lower than the designer's intentions. This<br><br>is an expensive-looking sweater-two-ply cashmere, she guesses-<br><br>and she doubts Marcus could afford to buy it for himself. She assumes it was a gift from someone who is very familiar with his face, one who knew how this gray-green shade would shake loose those evasive hues from his multifaceted brown eyes. Definitely a gift. He doesn't even have the cash to care for this item properly with regular dry- cleaning.

Butler arrived in Buffalo, New York, to found a newspaper eventually called the Buffalo Evening News. Under Butler&#39;s aegis the News became one of the most successful newspapers in America, growing along with the thriving city at the end of the Erie Canal, which was expanding rapidly as immigrants poured in and America urbanized. About a century later, in 1977, financial investor Warren E. Buffett, recognizing the value of the paper, bought the Buffalo Evening News, and to this day, despite competition from large media conglomerates, the Buffalo News (as it is now called) remains a successful independent publication.There is no one better to tell the story of the News than Murray B. Light, who held senior editorial positions at the paper for over thirty years. Beginning with the founding of the newspaper by Butler, Light provides a wealth of historical information and many in-depth, behind-the-scenes profiles of key persons who influenced the course of the paper. Chief among these is founder Edward H. Butler, a dynamo of energy, whose enthusiasm, innovation, and high standards are still felt to this day. His son, Edward Butler Jr., also played an important role, extending the reach of the News into radio and television, as did his extraordinary wife, Kate Robinson Butler, who also served as publisher. Almost as influential as the senior Butler was Alfred H. Kirchhofer, whose strong personality and work ethic, staunch Republican Party connections, and active involvement in the Buffalo community became legendary.

Butler arrived in Buffalo, New York, to found a newspaper eventually called the BUFFALO EVENING NEWS. Under the enterprising Butler's aegis the NEWS became one of the most successful newspapers in America, growing along with the thriving city at the end of the Erie Canal, which was expanding rapidly as immigrants poured in and America urbanized. About a century later, in 1977, financial investor Warren E. Buffet, recognizing the value of the paper, bought the BUFFALO EVENING NEWS, and, to this day, despite competition from large media conglomerates, the BUFFALO NEWS (as it is now called) remains a successful independent publication. <p>There is no better person to tell the story of the NEWS than Murray B. Light, who held senior editorial positions at the paper for over thirty years. Beginning with the founding of the newspaper by Butler, Light provides a wealth of historical information and many in-depth, behind-the-scenes profiles of key persons who influenced the course of the paper. Chief among these is founder Edward H. Butler, a dynamic powerhouse whose enthusiasm, innovation, and high standards are still felt today. His son, Edward Butler Jr., played an important role, extending the reach of the News corporation into radio and television, as did his extraordinary wife, Kate Robinson Butler, who also served as publisher. Almost as influential as the senior Butler was Alfred H. Kirchhofer, whose strong personality and work ethic, staunch Republican Party connections, and active involvement in the Buffalo community became legendary.

An awkward misfit, loathed by his powerful and autocratic grandmother, nine-year-old Fulke FitzWarin leaves his family to be fostered in the household of Joscelin de Dinan, Lord of Ludlow. Here Fulke will learn knightly arts, but before he can succeed, he must overcome the deep-seated doubts that hold him back. Hawise FitzWarin is Joscelin&#39;s youngest daughter and she befriends Fulke. As they grow up, an implacable enemy threatens Ludlow and as the pressure mounts, their friendship changes until one fateful day they find themselves staring at each other across a divide. Not only does Fulke have to overcome the shadows of his childhood, he faces a Welsh threat to his family&#39;s lands, and the way he feels about Hawise endangers all his hard won confidence. As the menace to Ludlow intensifies, he must either confront the future head on, or fail on all counts, not knowing if Hawise stands with or against him.</p><p>New York Times bestselling author Elizabeth Chadwick has written over 20 historical novels sold in 18 languages worldwide.

Growing bored with the adult dalliance, Brunin had meandered off to explore the booths on his own. He was a lanky child with an olive complexion and eyes of so deep a brown that they were almost black, hence his nickname, his true appellation being Fulke, the same as his father. His five brothers were fair like their parents. Brunin, it was said by the charitable, was a throwback to his grandsire, a Lorraine mercenary of doubtful origins. Those less generous muttered that he was a changeling child, a cuckoo laid in the nest by the faery folk of the Welsh hills.</p> <p>He passed a cookstall where soft oatcakes were being smartly turned on a griddle and sold to passersby. A woman had bought several and was dividing them among her swarming offspring. She reprimanded one child with exasperation, but a moment later ruffled his hair. Catching Brunin's wistful gaze, she smiled, tore a side from a remaining oatcake, and offered it to him as if coaxing a wild thing. Brunin shook his head and moved quickly away. It was not the oatcake that had caused his yearning look.</p> <p>"Jugs and pitchers!" a trader shouted in his ear. "Pottles and pots! Finest wares of Stamford and Nottingham!" The man waved aloft a green-glazed jug with the design of a grinning face carved in the spout. A pugnacious housewife was haggling vigorously with his assistant over the price of a cooking jar.</p> <p>For three days every summer, traders came to Shrewsbury and arrayed their wares in the shadow of the great Benedictine abbey of Saints Peter and Paul. Even the unrest of the civil war between the supporters of King Stephen and the Empress Matilda could not dampen people's enthusiasm for bargains and rarities. Brunin's father said that, if anything, the unrest made the fair even more popular because men could meet allies and discuss common ground while seen to be engaged in legitimate pursuits.</p> <p>That's where his father was now, talking to old friends, and that was why Brunin had been put in Mark's charge. They were supposed to meet FitzWarin at the horse market when the abbey bell rang the hour of sext. Brunin was to have a new pony since he was rapidly outgrowing the small Welsh bay that had served him since he was six years old. Spider legs his grandmother had called him last week, as if his sudden growth spurt was a sin.</p> <p>The language of trade assaulted his ears from all quarters. The Latin and French of wealthier stall-holders were familiar to him. Here and there, a Welsh voice soared above a babbling undercurrent of English. Brunin spoke a smattering of the two latter tongues-but never in his grandmother's hearing unless he deliberately wanted to annoy her.</p> <p>The cloth stalls were heaving with women who eyed and fingered, discussed, longed for, and occasionally bought. Brunin's mother had a silk dress of the same shimmering red-gold as one of the bolts draped over a booth counter. He had seen it in her clothing coffer, but she rarely wore it. She had told him once with blank eyes that it was her wedding gown.</p> <p>Brunin paused at a trader's cart to fondle a litter of brindle hound pups. The trader also had a pair of tiny dogs with long, silky fur and colorful ribbons tied around their necks. The sound of their yapping hurt Brunin's ears. He tried to imagine his father entertaining such lap rats in his household and grinned at the image. FitzWarin was strictly a hound man, the larger the better.</p> <p>Ambling toward the horse market, Brunin wondered if he could steer his father's eye in the direction of a pied or jet-black pony this time-something that would stand out from common chestnut and brown. Of course, unusual colors cost more and if the price was not reasonable, his father would refuse to buy.</p> <p>To reach the horse fair, Brunin had to cut down the thoroughfare where the weapon smiths had set out their stalls. The sight of the shining sword blades, the axes, daggers, hauberks, helms, and sundry accoutrements of the warrior's craft seized both his sight and his imagination. Here was a knife in a tooled leather sheath just like the one Mark wore at his hip, here a sword with a grip of red braid and an inscription scrolled in Latin down the blade. Brunin's mouth watered. Sometimes he would draw his father's sword from its scabbard and pretend that he was the great warrior Roland, defending the pass at Roncesvalles against the Infidel. His grandmother had caught him once and thrashed him for leaving sticky fingerprints on the polished iron. He had been more circumspect since-and, mindful of her words, he always cleaned the sword on his tunic before putting it away.</p> <p>A nobleman and his entourage arrived at the booth where Brunin was eyeing up the weaponry and began inspecting the swords. Brunin watched the lord heft the blade that the craftsman handed to him.</p> <p>"Good balance," the lord nodded. "Grip's a little short. I don't want to lose my finger ends in battle." He swiped the sword through the air, testing the feel, following through with a deft backswing before handing the weapon around for an opinion.</p> <p>"That can be changed if you like the blade, my lord," said the trader. "Or there's this one." He presented another sword, this one scabbarded in tactile, rose-colored leather.</p> <p>Captivated, Brunin moved closer and was immediately pushed aside by a fair-haired squire attending the noble. "Out of the way, brat," he sneered. "Get back to your nursemaid."</p> <p>Brunin flushed. The youth was wearing a tunic of blood-red wool and had a knife at his belt not much smaller than Mark's. One hand hovered close to the hilt as if he were thinking of drawing it. Eyeing the implied threat, Brunin began to feel queasy.</p> <p>"He's lost his tongue," grinned a younger, stocky youth in blue. "Unless he's Welsh and doesn't understand us. He looks Welsh, doesn't he?"</p> <p>Brunin lifted his chin. Every muscle was stiff with the effort of holding his ground. "I'm not W-Welsh," he said.</p> <p>The lord ceased examining his second sword and glanced around. "Ernalt, Gerald, leave the boy alone. Let him look if he desires." His tone was tolerant. "What's your name, boy?"</p> <p>Brunin delved for his manners. "Fulke, sir," he said, using his formal birth name. "Fulke F-FitzWarin..."</p> <p>The humor faded from the man's eyes. "Of Whittington?"</p> <p>"Yes, sir."</p> <p>"And what might you be doing strolling the booths on your own?"</p> <p>"Waiting for my father," Brunin answered.</p> <p>The noble raised his head and gazed around as if expecting to see Brunin's father among the crowd. "Then perhaps you would do better not to wait in my vicinity," he said. His voice had lost its warmth. "If your sire is as careless with his lands as he is with his son, he may well end up losing both." Turning his back on Brunin with a deliberate air of dismissal, he handed the sword to the craftsman and set about discussing terms.</p> <p>Brunin was bewildered. He did not understand the sudden change, but knew enough to realize that his presence was unwelcome and that it must have something to do with his father. He started to walk away and received a hefty shove in the middle of his back. Stumbling, surprised, he turned to find himself facing the blond squire and his companion.</p> <p>"Know what happens to a cub when it wanders too far from the den?" the blond one asked in a voice straining in the space between boy and man. He drew his knife.</p> <p>Brunin swallowed and his queasiness increased.</p> <p>"You think he's afraid?" The stocky boy gave Brunin another shove, a predatory glint in his eyes.</p> <p>"Of course he is."</p> <p>"I'm n-not!" Brunin contradicted. Something strange was happening to his bladder, as if the blond squire's blade was sawing through his ability to control it.</p> <p>The youth thumbed the tip of the weapon and then ran his finger lightly across the edge. "You should be, whelp," he said. "Perhaps I'll cut off your little tail and send you home to your pack with a stump, eh?" He sliced the steel descriptively under Brunin's nose.</p> <p>Brunin flinched. He knew it wasn't manly but couldn't help himself. He wished he were back at the guest house with his mother and brothers and even his grandmother. He wished he were still with Mark and bored stiff.</p> <p>The squire in blue grabbed Brunin's arm. "Shall I hold him down?"</p> <p>"If you like."</p> <p>Terror shot through Brunin like a molten wire. Drawing back his foot he kicked his captor in the shin and, twisting, bit the hand that was gripping his elbow. The youth yelled and let go. Brunin took to his heels. Winding among the booths, he was as swift and pliable as an eel between rocks, but his pursuers were fast too and there were two of them. Brunin darted toward the stall where he had left Mark supping ale and cozening the girl but, to his horror, the young serjeant was no longer there.</p> <p>The girl scowled over the counter at the wild-eyed, panting boy. "He's gone looking for you." Her tone indicated that she was furious at having her flirtation curtailed. "You're in trouble, you are."</p> <p>He didn't need to be told. "Please..." he croaked, but it was too late. The squires grabbed him one either side and held him fast. When the girl looked askance, the fair-haired one winked at her. "Young rascal," he said. Reassured, she turned away, abandoning Brunin to his fate.</p> <p>He fought the youths with every shred of strength in his narrow body, but he was no match for their adolescent brawn. Their fingers bruised his flesh as they dragged him across the fairground. A hard hand cupped his mouth to stifle his yells, and when he tried again to bite, he felt the cold burn of the knife at his throat. A sudden, shameful heat flooded his braies and stained his hose.</p> <p>"God's bones, the weakling's pissed himself!" the stocky youth jeered.</p> <p>His blond companion snorted. "What do you expect of blood like his? The wonder is it's red, not yellow." He showed Brunin his smeared fingers then dragged them down the boy's cheek.</p> <p>"If you cut out his liver, I'll warrant you half a mark that it would be the color of buttercups."</p> <p>"Half a mark? Done."</p> <p>"Boys!" The voice was peremptory and stern. Through a stinging blur of tears, Brunin saw the dark figure of a Benedictine monk blocking their path, arms folded high on his chest, and expression stern. "What are you doing?"</p> <p>"None of your business," sneered the older youth.</p> <p>The monk raised one thin silver eyebrow. "I can make it so very quickly indeed," he said coldly. "Let him go and be on your way."</p> <p>The stand-off was short. Bravado the squires possessed in bucketloads, but they were lads, not grown men. Faced by the charisma and authority of the Church, they grudgingly capitulated and, pushing Brunin to his knees, swaggered off. At a distance, the blond one turned.</p> <p>"Your liver's mine, piss-hose!" he shouted. "And I'll come back for it!"</p> <p>Brunin stared at the dusty grass inches from his eyes. A dark drop of blood plopped from the knife wound and ran down the stems to soak into the soil. He could hear his breath sawing in his chest and breaking over his larynx in hoarse sobs. He wondered if he was dying and wished that he were already dead.</p> <p>"How now, child." The monk stooped and raised Brunin to his feet. "What had you done to them to make them set on you?"</p> <p>"Nothing," Brunin gulped in a quavering voice and sleeved his eyes. He felt sick and his legs wobbled like a foal's.</p> <p>The monk gently tilted Brunin's head to one side so that he could see the cut on his throat. "No more than a nick," he said, "but it could have been nasty indeed." He clucked his tongue and spoke more to himself than Brunin. "Every year, with the revenues, this fair brings us these squalid troubles, the more so since men quarrel over who rules the kingdom." He drew Brunin gently toward the abbey precincts. "Come, child, let us find some salve for that scratch and a place for you to sit a moment." His gaze was shrewd. "If you are not a foundling, which I judge not by the cut of your tunic, someone will be looking for you."</p> <p>***</p> <p>Fulke FitzWarin, lord of the castles of Whittington and Alberbury and more than fifteen estates in the counties of Shropshire, Staffordshire, Devonshire, and Cambridgeshire, took a drink of wine, rolled it experimentally around his mouth, and swallowed. He handed the cup to his companion. "What do you think?"</p> <p>Joscelin de Dinan sniffed the brew and, under the anxious eyes of the hovering vintner, set the rim to his lips. "Not bad," he said, wiping his mouth. The creases at his eye corners deepened as he smiled. "Certainly I wouldn't be insulted if you served it to me."</p> <p>FitzWarin grunted with amusement. "Useful to know I don't have to broach my best wine to satisfy you then." He raised his forefinger to the vintner. "I'll take thirty barrels. You can haggle the price with my steward." He set the cup under the spigot of the sample barrel and refilled it. Around them the crowds ebbed and flowed in rapid tidal surges. The vintners' booths were always busy and it was best to visit them early while there was plenty of choice.</p> <p>It was good to be out in the sun-soaked morning with no more pressing business than the pleasure of talking to old friends, restocking the wine supplies, and the later prospect of exploring the horse market and weapon booths.</p> <p>"Your steward?" Joscelin raised his brows. "Not your mother?"</p> <p>FitzWarin laughed and pushed his heavy hazel-brown hair off his forehead. "Doubtless she'll have her say but for the moment her mind is fixed on buying cloth and thread for sewing. Sometimes there are just more pies than she has fingers." His mother's reputation was legendary among the baronial community of the Welsh Marches. It was said by many, sometimes to his face, that the lady Mellette was a match for any dragon that happened out of Wales. She was five years past three score but had more stamina than FitzWarin's wife who was less than half her age.</p> <p>The men enjoyed a few more samples. Joscelin wanted some Rhenish and FitzWarin bought a firkin of sweet, potent mead.</p> <p>"There is something I have been meaning to ask you," FitzWarin said as they sauntered companionably away from the wine booths. His feet were steady, his balance good, but he could feel his tongue wanting to run away with him. Joscelin's cheekbones bore a red flush that made his smoke-gray eyes gleam like polished flints.</p> <p>"As long as it is not about my daughters," Joscelin said, only half in jest. With two stepdaughters, two girls of his own blood, and no son, Joscelin de Dinan was constantly being petitioned by men who desired a future stake in the strategic castle and prosperous town of Ludlow.</p> <p>"No." FitzWarin shook his head. "It is about my son...my eldest," he qualified, for he had six. "It is past time that he began his training. The lad's ten years old now. I was wondering if you....</p></p><h2>Under Red Skies: Three Generations of Life, Loss, and Hope in China</h2><p><b>A deeply personal and shocking look at how China is coming to terms with its conflicted past as it emerges into a modern, cutting-edge superpower. </b><br><br>Through the stories of three generations of women in her family, Karoline Kan, a former <i>New York Times</i> reporter based in Beijing, reveals how they navigated their way in a country beset by poverty and often-violent political unrest.

CRY TO HEAVEN is my favorite Anne Rice novel, next to MEMNOCH THE DEVIL. Anne Rice has a real gift for transporting her readers to a different time and place.

Lewis's biting satire received a 1999 Grammy nomination for best spoken-word performance, and it's easy to see why--the story fits the format perfectly. It's relatively brief (the unabridged reading takes a mere four hours), and contains only one character--the demon Screwtape, who writes letters to his novice nephew Wormwood, instructing him on how to best tempt his "patient" (a wayward soul on earth) into the bosom of "our Lord below." <p> Obviously, the book wasn't written with former Monty Python John Cleese in mind, but it's hard to imagine a better Screwtape. Cleese's voice provides the perfect vehicle for Lewis's dry, razor-edged wit. His uncanny comic timing and ability to milk each phrase for maximum effect betray an infectious enthusiasm for the story. It's clear that he's having a great time reading, and it's impossible not to laugh along with him. This inspired pairing of two of the 20th century's greatest wits makes for a meditation on the dark side of spiritual guidance that's as relevant and funny today as it was in Lewis's war-torn England. (Running time: 4 hours, 3 cassettes) --<i>Andrew Neiland</i></p>His letters are signed, save one, "Your affectionate uncle", yet Uncle Screwtape's purposes in writing to his young nephew are hardly innocent. Penned in a brisk, businesslike style, old Screwtape offers the gullible Tempter Wormword fiendishly clever advice on his most pressing concern: the winning of young lives to the devil.<p>First published in 1941, The Screwtape Letters, a perennial best seller, has earned a place in the library of classics. The truths contained in C. S. Lewis's treatise on human nature are as old as the world, but his witty observations continue to confront and challenge believers and nonbelievers alike.</p><p>The outcome of Screwtape's correspondence is not known.

I was born on December 7, 1932, in Denton, Texas. My parents owned a small grocery and school supply store. We had a variety of dogs, cats, and chickens and a wonderful vegetable garden. My dad subscribed to three newspapers and read aloud to us at the dinner table. My parents believed in education, honesty, and dedication to task. Their love of books and reading was not preached but modeled.</p><p>"My elementary school was part of the University of North Texas. Its curriculum included special programs and other opportunities for students to answer their many<i> whys</i>. Most elementary schools of those years had neither library nor librarian. We were lucky to have a librarian and teachers who brought the best of children's books to our attention.</p><p>"I loved everything about our school library. My memories include marvelous hidden corners, delicious smells of lacquer (this was before protective plastic book jackets), wonderful drawers filled with cards, and magazines and books. I decided to become a librarian in the fourth grade and never wavered. I entered the University of North Texas to study library service, but I had other dreams as well: I could imagine myself working in a bookstore or for a New York City publisher, I knew nothing about publishing, but I knew I had to be doing something with books. Although I had kept diaries as a child, it never occurred to me that I might become an author.</p><p>"I worked as a librarian, in Delaware and New Mexico, and then in 1966, when I moved to Irving, Texas, I was asked by the Irving independent School District to establish a library program. The past thirty years have sped by. In 1991 our program was recognized by the American Association of School Libraries and the Encyclopaedia Britannica Corporation as the most outstanding library media program in the United States. My active role with the Irving Independent School District ended in March 1996. I now spEND </p><p>more time writing and doing author visits and library-related workshops.</p><p>"All four of my children are now grown, and I have six grandchildren -- five boys and a girl, I still enjoy working with teachers, administrators, and librarians, and find the new technology and its roles in libraries very exciting. I was most pleased to be honored with the Texas Library Association Distinguished Service Award and the University of North Texas Distinguished Alumni award.</p><p>"There are still so many whys. My first books were for adults, based on the workshops I conduct for teachers and librarians. I then began to write for children, spurred on by my curiosity, love of travel, and interest in the rich diversity of people all over the world as well as right here in our own country. Currently I am finishing a book about the celebration of Christmas in the United States. I love visiting schools to talk with teachers and students about the many ways, and the many joys, of writing."</p></p><h2>Horses Heifers and Hairy Pigs</h2><p>Based at the Skeldale Veterinary Centre, in Thirsk, North Yorkshire, the modern, relocated practice featured in the classic stories of James Herriot, and with a foreword by James Herriot&#39;s son, this is a warm and evocative memoir from a young vet whose love for his vocation shines through on every page. From alpacas to exotic pigs, puppies to rabbits, Julian has treated them all and his book is packed with stories about his loveable patients and will prove a firm favourite with all animal lovers. Dealing with unexpected exotic pets - and handling excitable humans too - Julian has seen all sides of the veterinary world and writes about it all with humour and affection. Just as happy calving a cow, treating a dehydrated chameleon or tending to the overgrown teeth of a rabbit, his passion for his work shines through on every page, as does his love for Yorkshire. Julian Norton also stars in Channel 5&#39;s fly-on-the-wall documentary series The Yorkshire Vet, one of the channel&#39;s highest rated shows (with series four set to return in 2017). Warm, evocative always compassionate and often funny, Julian&#39;s tales bring to life the world of the working vet and the highs and lows he and his colleagues face on a daily basis.</p><p>Julian Norton qualified as a veterinary surgeon from Cambridge Veterinary School in 1996. He has spent most of his working life in his beloved North Yorkshire. In 2015, Skeldale Veterinary Centre became involved with filming the Channel 5 television series The Yorkshire Vet, in which Julian has the title role. Outside of work, Julian is a keen triathlete and ski mountaineer. He has represented team GB at age-group level for both middle-distance triathlon and long-course duathlon. He is currently training to compete in a team for the major ski mountaineering race, La Patrouille des Glaciers, which traverses the high peaks of Switzerland. He is married to Anne, also a veterinary surgeon, and has two sons, Jack and Archie, a Jack Russell terrier called Emmy, and two guinea pigs called Sparkle and Shine.</p><h2>A New Religious America: How a &#34;Christian Country&#34; Has Become the World&#39;s Most Religiously Diverse Nation</h2><p><p>"The United States is the most religiously diverse nation in the world," leading religious scholar Diana Eck writes in this eye-opening guide to the religious realities of America today. The Immigration Act of 1965 eliminated the quotas linking immigration to national origins. Since then, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, Jams, Zoroastrians, and new varieties of Jews and Catholics have arrived from every part of the globe, radically altering the religious landscape of the United States. Members of the world's religions live not just on the other side of the world but in our neighborhoods; Hindu children go to school with Jewish children; Muslims, Buddhists, and Sikhs work side-by-side with Protestants and Catholics.</p><p>This new religious diversity is now a Main Street phenomenon, yet many Americans remain unaware of the profound change taking place at every level of our society, from local school boards to Congress, and in small-town Nebraska as well as New York City. Islamic centers and mosques, Hindu and Buddhist temples, and meditation centers can be found in virtually every major American metropolitan area. There are Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists in Salt Lake City, Utah; Toledo, Ohio; and Jackson, Mississippi. Buddhism has become an American religion, as communities widely separated in Asia are now neighbors in Los Angeles, Seattle, and Chicago. Eck discovers Muslims worshiping in a U-Haul dealership in Pawtucket, Rhode Island; a gymnasium in Oklahoma City; and a former mattress showroom in Northridge, California. Hindu temples are housed in a warehouse in Queens, a former YMCA in New Jersey, and a former Methodist church in Minneapolis.</p><p>How Americans of all faiths and beliefs can engage with one another to shape a positive pluralism is one of the essential questions -- perhaps the most important facing American society. While race has been the dominant American social issue in the past century, religious diversity in our civil and neighborly lives is emerging, mostly unseen, as the great challenge of the twenty-first century. Diana Eck brilliantly analyzes these developments in the richest and most readable investigation of American society since Robert Bellah's classic, <em>The Habits of the Heart.</em> What Eck gives us in <em>A New Religious America</em> is a portrait of the diversity of religion in modern America, complete with engaging characters, fascinating stories, the tragedy of misunderstanding and hatred, and the hope of new friendships, offering a road map to guide us all in the richly diverse America of the twenty-first century.</p><p>An eye-opening Account of the changing Landscape of America</p><li>The 1990s saw the U.S. Navy commission its first Muslim chaplain and open its first mosque.</li><li>There are presently more than three hundred temples in Los Angeles, home to the greatest variety of Buddhists in the world.</li><li>There are more American Muslims than there are American Episcopalians, Jews, or Presbyterians.</li></p><p><p>Diana L. Eck is Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies at Harvard University and is Master of Lowell House and Director of The Pluralism Project. As a Christian, she has also been involved in the United Methodist Church, the World Council of Churches, and the life of Harvard Divinity School. Her book Encountering God: A Spiritual Journey from Bozeman to Banaras won the prestigious Grawemeyer Book Award. In 1998, President Clinton awarded her the National Humanities Medal for the work of The Pluralism Project in the investigation of America's religious diversity.</p>Eck, professor of comparative religion at Harvard University, delivers a stunning tour de force that may forever change the way Americans claim to be "one nation, under God." Drawing on her work with the Pluralism Project, an ongoing study of religious diversity in the United States, Eck focuses here on the explosion of Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist communities in America, particularly since 1965. How has the growth of these religions changed the American landscape? And just as important, how are the religions themselves changing because of America? Eck's travels take her (and us) to major cities, but also to places such as Greenville, S.C.; Portland, Maine; and Toledo, Ohio. Eck is a highly skilled ethnographer who delicately balances the challenge of interpreting events while also participating in them. The success of this portrait lies in the details: in the Nikes and Reeboks that adorn the shoe racks in Sikh gurdwaras, Islamic mosques and Hindu temples; in the Muslim Girl Scout who promises to "serve Allah and my country"; in the consecration rituals at a Massachusetts Hindu temple, where the waters of India's sacred Ganges River are mixed with the Mississippi and poured freely over the building. Eck does far more than simply document the presence of religious diversity in America; she places it in historical context and illustrates the ongoing challenges it presents by describing legal battles and pivotal court cases. The last chapters address the rise of religiously motivated hate crimes and, conversely, the innovative ways some communities have welcomed religious pluralism. This is not just a book; it is a celebration.

Auchincloss<br><br>This is the culminating work of the finest living critic of American literature.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alfred Kazin brings a lifetime of thought and reading to the triumphant elucidation of his fascinating and slippery subjects: what the meaning of God has been for American writers, and how those writers, from the New England Calvinists to William Faulkner, have expressed it. In a series of trenchant critical studies of writers as divergent as Hawthorne, Melville, Emerson, Lincoln, Whitman, Dickinson, Twain, William James, Eliot, Frost, and Faulkner, Kazin gives a profound sense of each, and his quotations from their works are artfully chosen to pursue the main theme. The centerpiece of the book is the reflection in American writing of the great American tragedy, the Civil War--so deeply involved in the whole complex issue of religion in America.&nbsp;&nbsp;An enthralling book by a major writer.<br><br>"This is a book about the place of God in the imaginative life of a country that for two centuries countenanced slavery and then engaged in a fratricidal war to end it. For Americans no subject is more compelling or, in its entanglement with the deepest roots of the national soul, more terrible. And no one has ever written as incisively, as movingly, or as unforgivingly about it as Alfred Kazin has here." <br>--Louis Menand<br>"In the era of willful obfuscation, Alfred Kazin is the good, clear word, a brilliant scholar and an original reader. His latest book, God and the American Writer, which comes fifty-five years after On Native Grounds, proves he has lost nothing and gives us everything he has."<br>--David Remnick<br><br> "American writers have been born into all sorts of religious sects, but have had to struggle in solitude to make sense of God. Alfred Kazin, a cosmos unto himself, has written brilliantly and affectingly of how a dozen or so of our finest authors--poets, novelists, philosophers, and one president--endured and illuminated that struggle. Kazin is sometimes passionate, even fierce, especially in his discussions of slavery and of his hero (and mine), Abraham Lincoln. But, as ever, Kazin's writing is tempered by an enormous American empathy and by his sense of irony about our country and its spiritual predicaments. Spare, sharp, and immensely learned, God and the American Writer is the most moving volume of criticism yet by our greatest living critic."<br>--Sean Wilentz</p><p>Arthur Miller, who has wrestled an angel or two of his own, had this to say about Kazin's literary/theological project, <i>God and the American Writer</i>: "The American writer's struggles to reject, accept, sublimate, or ignore God is the stem around which Kazin has wound his fascinating insights into the works of our masters. It is a profound pleasure to read such inspired good sense." This praise is especially merited by his writing about the poets Emily Dickinson (Kazin writes about the "power and depth of her solitude"), and Walt Whitman (whose rowdy, sexual, corporeal, and pantheistic poetry, Kazin says, sought to "rescue religion by replacing it"). Whitman and Dickinson are, in many ways, the yin and yang of American approaches to spirituality. To create literature is to engage reality, to try to wrest some truth from the particulars of a life. This is an almost inevitably religious undertaking, and Kazin shows how that struggle informs the work of America's greatest writers, among them Ralph Waldo Emerson, Robert Frost, and T. S. Eliot.Alfred Kazin was born in Brooklyn in 1915. His first book of criticism, On Native Grounds (1942), was a groundbreaking study of American literature that changed radically our way of looking at it, and established him overnight as a major figure. In a series of books of his own since then, and in many critically edited texts of classic American literary works, he has established himself as our preeminent man of letters. He has taught widely at Harvard, Smith, Amherst, Hunter College, the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and elsewhere. In 1996 he received from the Truman Capote Literary Trust its first Lifetime Achievement Award in Literary Criticism (in memory of Newton Arvin). He lives in New York City.</p><h2>Shampoo Planet</h2><p>Despite their differing values, Tyler Johnson, an ambitious hotel management student, tries to console his mother, a former hippie, when Dan, his land-developer stepfather, decides to get a divorce</p><p>Douglas Coupland was born on a Canadian NATO base in Beden-Sollingen, (West) Germany on December 30, 1961. He is the author of bestselling fiction, including GENERATION X, LIFE AFTER GOD, POLAROIDS FROM THE DEAD, MICROSERFS, GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA and ALL FAMILIES ARE PSYCHOTIC.Still a cultural pulse-taker, Coupland (Generation X, 1991) organizes his hip bromides and next-wave sententiousness into a rather humdrum narrative that's long on posturing, short on plot. Laughing at disaster, Coupland's post-post-baby-boomers rationalize the culture of constant change, self-reinvention, and immediate gratification. Tyler Johnson, the 20-year-old narrator whose ``memories begin with Ronald Reagan,'' is an apocalyptic entrepreneur, a hotel-motel studies major who believes wholeheartedly in a boundless future, one he hopes to see as an employee for a northwestern conglomerate presided over by his personal hero, the CEO author of Life at the Top. A smart and glib media savant, Tyler speaks ``telethon-ese'' with his girlfriend and dubs his room at home the ``modernarium.'' His mother, Jasmine, a hippie with armpit hair and a ``predilection for substance enthusiasts,'' represents everything that was wrong (in Tyler's view) about the Sixties. His grandparents, on the other hand, hoard their wealth and greedily pursue their pyramid sales scheme, marketing a cat food ``system.'' Meanwhile, Tyler's summer fling in Paris comes to haunt him. The haughty and selfish Stephanie, one of the ``low-ambition Euro-teens'' he met on vacation, convinces him to move to L.A. with her in pursuit of fame and riches. Their adventures on the road include a visit to the commune where Tyler was born and a nightmarish stay at his father's drug farm. In L.A., Tyler works a fast-food ``McJob,'' while Stephanie secretly finds a sugar-daddy. Chastened by his low-life in la-la-land, Tyler returns home, rewarded with a dream job and a happier family. This TV/computer/video-savvy fiction is a frank celebration of life as a series of theme parks. Coupland's social commentary is, at its worst, fortune-cookie profound and, at best, a gloss on the Zeitgeist. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

From its first edition, a small give-away booklet of 16 pages, it has grown into a 864-page "almanac" of biblical information, used regularly by hundreds of thousands of laymen, teachers, and ministers. Halley's Bible handbook contains more biblical information than any other book its size. It has been a continuous best-seller through the years and has sold more than five million copies in many languages. On April 28, 1961, the GUTENBERG AWARD was presented to Dr. Henry H.

A total of 152 works from Beuys&#x2019;s many fields of activity&#x2015;drawings and watercolors, prints and multiples, sculptures and objects, spaces and happenings&#x2015;arranged in chronological order demonstrate the artist&#x2019;s formal versatility, creative richness, and conceptual depth. The peculiar poetry of the materials Beuys used&#x2015;felt, grease, honey, wax, copper, and sulfur&#x2015;emerges along with the gentle melancholy that suffuses the work. Alain Borer analyzes the world of Beuys&#x2019;s thoughts and imagination with special reference to the artist&#x2019;s written and spoken statements.<br><br> This survey is an essential introduction to the work and conceptual world of Joseph Beuys that will appeal to anyone interested in twentieth-century art. 160 illustrations in color and black-and-white</p><p>Joseph Beuys (1921-1986), who reached cult status in his native Germany, was perhaps the most important artist to emerge in Europe after WW II; he was certainly the most influential thinker and teacher among artists of the postwar generation. His doctrine was that &#34;every man is an artist,&#34; and his more radical aims included a restructuring of the economy and free access to all educational institutions. Beuys considered art a medium for social and political change, and the prosaic materials he employed--felt, animal fat, and wax were among his favorites--had a spiritual dimension and could be invested by the artist with healing power. His iconic &#34;felt suit,&#34; for instance, expresses the idea of physical warmth. Arranged chronologically and spanning four decades, this is the only book that provides a definitive survey of this innovative artist&#39;s work in every medium--from drawings, sculptures, and printed works to objects, environments, and actions.Alain Borer is a French poet and writer.

The Capitol was located in New York City. The vast area west of the Appalachian Mountains to the Mississippi River was acquired from Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris in 1783. This area was bordered on the north by Canada and on the south by the Ohio River and encompassed the present day states of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin. The Government of Great Britain had claimed this territory and by the signing of numerous treaties the Indians living there had given up most of their rights to this land. The British forbid white settlement there to appease the Indians. At the end of the American Revolution, the United States now claimed this territory by &#x201c;Right of Conquest&#x201d; over Great Britain and with the creation of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 opened it up for white settlement against the protests of the Indians who still considered it their land. The first permanent American settlement northwest of the Ohio River was Marietta in the year 1788 and soon after more and more pioneers flooded into the country. It was not an easy life for these early pioneers. They had to deal with hostile Indians, disease, starvation and the lack of basic necessities, but they made it and the State of Ohio was admitted into the union in 1803. This book chronicles the events from the earliest explorations of the territory, the purchase of lands by The Ohio Company, the early settlements and the trying times of the early pioneers who settled and tamed this original Northwest Territory.

The explanation for which materials to use and how they affect the finished picture are invaluable to a novice and probably act as a nice reminder for the more advanced artist. I enjoyed the way the author demonstrates how one step builds on another, including the use of ovals to form the basis for a figure and the curved lines to suggest motion. This is a book that can encourage one to explore realms only limited by one's own imagination and shows that there are multiple ways to look at something, as each artist demonstrates a unique style of fairies. I think there is something for everyone, whether a casual doodler or a serious artist, as step by step drawings and in-depth discussions of composition, effects of light placement and techniques for giving texture through materials used and judicious application of water are all described. This is a book that has the potential to provide countless hours of entertainment with the delightful side effect of adding beauty to one's surroundings."<br>&#x2014;<i>Night Owl Reviews, www.nightowlreviews.com</i></p><h2>Dark Angels: A Novel (Tamworth Saga)</h2><p><b>The long-awaited prequel to Koen&#x2019;s beloved <i>Through a Glass Darkly</i>, <i>Dark Angels</i> is a feast of a novel that sparkles with all the passion, extravagance, danger, and scandal of seventeenth-century England. </b><br><br>Alice Verney is a young woman intent on achieving her dreams. Returning to England after a messy scandal forced her to flee to Louis XIV&#x2019;s France, Alice is anxious to re-establish herself by regaining her former position as a maid of honor to Charles II&#x2019;s queen and marrying the most celebrated duke of the Restoration. <br><br> But all is not as it seems in the rowdy, merry court of Charles II.

It was the fleet of the kingdom of England, sent to escort precious cargo: a princess of England and France, the most famous princess in Christendom, in fact. A yacht with a rakish bow slashed through the water toward the best and greatest of these anchored ships; the king on board liked fast yachts, fast horses, fast women. The princess was his sister, and he and those with him could not wait to see her.<br><br> "Monmouth's on the yacht!" said a young woman leaning over the side of the princess's ship. She had stepped atop a huge coil of rope for this view, and a sailor, eyeing her satins and the single strand of fat pearls at her neck, had warned her to be careful, but she'd sent him off with a withering comment to mind his own business. She wasn't one to suffer fools--or even those who weren't fools--telling her what to do. The sight of King Charles's yacht racing toward them was thrilling. She could see the crowd waiting on shore. The queen and her father and her best friend were among them. She was so glad to see England again, she wasn't certain she'd be able to keep herself from kneeling on the beach and kissing the sand of it when she landed.<br><br> "And who else is there?" asked the friend with her, like her a maid of honor to the princess, and like her, excited to be witnesses to this, King Charles and his sister meeting again after so many years--ten if it was a day. Flags were flying from all the topmasts, whipping smartly in the breeze. The day was bright and clear. Everyone was dressed in their finest, felt high-spirited, mettlesome as horses, stirred and thrilled by this reunion.<br><br> "Climb up here and see for yourself!" Alice said.<br><br> "Don't tease, Alice, and don't fall--" Her friend, Louise Renee, grabbed Alice's gown, for by now Alice was leaning over the edge at a dangerous angle, the feet in her dainty satin shoes on tiptoe.<br><br> "The Duke of York is with His Majesty and Prince Rupert--oh, they're close enough to hear me--Rupert! Prince Rupert! Monmouth!" Shrieking the names, Alice waved a gauzy scarf back and forth with wild abandon and was rewarded with a hearty wave from the king's cousin, a smile from the king's son, and a startled glance and then a grin from King Charles himself. Loud cheers had come up from hundreds of throats, the throats of the sailors manning the ships, the throats of the crowd on shore. They, too, were waving and clapping, cheering the king. Gulls, who'd idly settled among the rigging, rose like winged blessings into the sky.<br><br> "He hasn't changed a whit," Alice said.<br><br> "Who?"<br><br> "The king. I wonder who he'll be flirting with by midnight--"<br><br> "Mademoiselle Verney, get down from there at once! Mademoiselle de Keroualle! You will join the other maids immediately! The king is boarding--"<br><br> It was the keeper of the maids, Madame Dragon, Alice called her.<br><br> Alice and Renee ran across the deck to join the elite circle of young women around the princess, all in satin gowns, in dainty shoes with stiff gauze bows, their hair coaxed by servants into curling orderly disorder, fat strands of pearls around their slender necks, drops at their delectable ears. As young women, unmarried, their very youth was beautiful. As part of the household of the foremost princess in France, they were everything that was fashionable. There wasn't a woman on shore who wouldn't be biting her lip with vexation and determining to buy new gowns once theirs were seen. They couldn't wait.<br><br> Princesse Henriette--her formal title at the French court was Madame--glanced toward Alice and Renee as they slipped in among the other women, a slight arch in her brow, both questioning and condemning.<br><br> "Pretty behavior," sneered a lithe young man to Alice, one of a group of restless and handsome noblemen, but then the orchestra that had been sent to accompany the princess struck up a lively tune, and all about them another cheer began from sailors in the rigging, from those standing in order on the deck as the sardonic face of the king of England, Charles, the second of that name, appeared just above the brass of the ship's railing. In another moment he had leaped to the deck.<br><br> "Minette." He held out his arms, his face made handsome by joy, and his sister ran to him, and he hugged her close and then swung her around, her skirt swelling out like a bell. Men had followed him over the side, appearing one after the other, dressed almost as sumptuously as any woman, laces, blue ribbons, diamond pins, long, curling hair, false, a wig but magnificent nonetheless. The princess was immediately surrounded by them. Her other brother, the Duke of York, hugged and kissed her, and their cousin Prince Rupert elbowed York out of the way unceremoniously and said, "Little beauty. I thought we'd never pry you from the Frenchies' grasp." Unfortunately, he spoke in French and loudly, so everyone near heard him.<br><br> The Duke of Monmouth, King Charles's son, insisted on his hug, and the princess danced from one male relative to another, kissing their faces and wiping at tears running down her face.<br><br> "She's ruining her rouge." It was the same young man who spoke before, with the same sneering, spiteful tone.<br><br> "We're in England now, d'Effiat. You'd best watch your tongue," Alice told him.<br><br> "Oh, I am afraid," he mocked her, and the others with him laughed maliciously, even Beuvron, who was her friend.<br><br> Alice turned her back on the group of them. The day was too happy to spoil with quarreling. There had been enough of that in France. This was adventure, huge adventure, and she was home at long last, about to see her best friend in the world, and the queen she so loved, and her father, and there was nothing d'Effiat or Beuvron or any of them could say to ruin a single moment.<br><br> Her eyes met Prince Rupert's, and he winked, then made her a bow.<br><br> Renee pointed to the king's son Monmouth. "He's handsome." She wasn't the only woman who'd noticed Monmouth.<br><br> "Yes, and he knows it, so beware."<br><br> Protocol, dear to French hearts, was being ignored. Everything was becoming very confused. The maids of honor had broken rank in spite of the Dragon's frowns, lured by Monmouth's smiles, by Rupert's twinkling boisterousness, by King Charles's laughter, by the sense of froth and frivolity that seemed to have climbed right on board with him.<br><br> Those who accompanied the princess from France, a duc here, a vicomte there, a priest or two, the captain of her household guard, tried to push past the clustered maids of honor, past the princess's tall brother and cousin, to introduce themselves over the noise of the orchestra and the bellows of that cousin, who seemed to be ordering something from above in the rigging.<br><br> He was. A great willow basket was being lowered from a pulley. Squeals from the maids of honor added to the growing melee as they rushed here and there to be out of its way. Once the basket was on deck, Prince Rupert patted it fondly, fell on one knee before his princess cousin, and made a motion for her to climb in, using his knee as step.<br><br> "I'm not to go overboard in this?" Princesse Henriette cried, delighted and horrified. She spoke in French because she'd lived in France all her life, and her English was small. "I haven't introduced--"<br><br> King Charles swept her up in his arms. "Introductions aren't necessary. We'll do what's proper on shore. But for now, I claim my sister as a prize of the sea. She's in English waters, and she's mine." With that, he placed her into the basket, giving one and all a glimpse of her stockings--vivid green--the princess laughing so hard, she couldn't speak.<br><br> "This is highly irregular--" began the French ambassador.<br><br> "Pay me a formal call to complain," said King Charles. His eyes, a rogue's eyes, swept over the maids of honor. "One beautiful woman isn't enough. My sister must have escort."<br><br> Young women everywhere held their breath, dropped into giggling, graceful curtsies as his eyes touched, considered, and admired each of them. The captain of the household guard cleared his throat. The Dragon hovered, fluttering, not certain what to do. No one knew at this point.<br><br> King Charles's eyes found Louise Renee de Keroualle, the most beautiful among them.<br><br> "Why am I not surprised?" Rupert said to his cousin York.<br><br> In a heartbeat, Renee stepped up on Rupert's knee and over into the basket. For a moment, her stockings showed, and they were the same green as the princess's. It was shocking and exciting.<br><br> King Charles's eyes found Alice. She had dropped as gracefully as a flower drooping. A gliding, natural grace of movement was one of her beauties. He walked over and stood before her, looking down at her bent head, the riot of curls there.<br><br> "My dear Verney."<br><br> "Sir."<br><br> "Her Majesty has missed you dreadfully."<br><br> "And I her." Her heart was beating very fast. He was her liege, her lord, her king. She'd known him since she was a child and he a penniless, beggar sovereign without a kingdom. This was a great and powerful moment.<br><br> "Did you behave yourself in France?"<br><br> "No, sir. And I am happy to say I have acquired the most beautiful gowns in the world."<br><br> "The better to finally find a husband with?"<br><br> A child of court, her skills polished to high gloss by going to France, she met his eyes. "That was my plan, sir."<br><br> "Lord Colefax was a fool. I do believe we've missed you." He held out his hand to help her rise, a signal honor. Enormously proud, Alice walked to the basket, cutting her eyes in a deliberate, provocative challenge to the group of sneering, fashionable young Frenchmen, impressed in spite of themselves. She stepped up onto Rupert's knee.<br><br> "Are your stockings green, also?" asked Prince Rupert.<br><br> It was all she could do not to kiss him on the cheek and add to the complete breakdown of decorum. She could see how shocked the French around her were. She bunched her skirts to climb into the basket, and the answer was evident. Sailors began to cheer, but whether it was for the glimpse of stocking or the jerking rise of the basket was unclear. There was an immediate bustle as the king, his brother, his cousin, and his son climbed over the side of the ship and down the rope ladder to the yacht, as nimble, as quick as any man in the rigging.<br><br> People from the French court ran to the ship's side. Everything was happening so fast! No one had been properly introduced! Nothing was going as planned! Other boats, yachts, wherries, rowboats, bobbed like corks some distance away--clearly those boats would bring them to shore, but they'd thought to have a reception on board, a long dinner. Speeches were planned!<br><br> Suspended over the water, Alice felt her heart rise like a lark. The sun was high and bright, the wind strong. The crowd on shore waved hats and large handkerchiefs, calling, hurrahing. The sea near the shore sent in wave after wave of little white frills, as if hundreds of serving maids had dropped caps in the water to celebrate this day. At the top of the sheer cliffs, the huge fortress of Dover Castle awaited them. She could see people standing on the parapets. Flags flapped at the corner turrets. The basket lurched toward one side. Princesse Henriette and Renee screamed. Alice took her scarf, held it over the side, where the wind clutched at it. The scarf was long, gauzy, made of spiderweb and forbidden Dutch lace by nimble nuns' fingers. Good-bye to quarreling, good-bye to meanness, and here's to my good fortune in England, she thought, and she let it go and screamed herself as the basket lurched straight downward, to the sound of a high, shrill trill of laughter from the princess.<br><br> On board the yacht, the king's Life Guards settled the basket, and one of them stepped forward to help the women out. Alice had the sensation of falling as she met his eyes.<br><br> "I know you," she said in English. "You're Robin Saylor, aren't you?"<br><br> "Richard, Lieutenant Richard Saylor, at your service."<br><br> He signaled for the basket to rise, led Princesse Henriette to a bench covered with cushions as the rest of royal family stepped one by one from the ladder. Another Life Guard quickly pulled up the anchor, the Duke of York took the tiller, Monmouth unfurled the sails, and the yacht was moving away from the ship.<br><br> "Mission performed admirably," said King Charles. "I didn't have to listen to a single speech. Rupert, you owe me twenty guineas." He smiled upon his sister. "As you can see, we are not as formal as King Louis."<br><br> Princesse Henriette leaned back against cushions, raised her face to the sun. "I don't know when I've laughed so much." She still spoke in French, but half the English court knew the language. So many had lived abroad during England's civil war.<br><br> "Are all your ladies wearing green stockings?"<br><br> "Only the pretty ones." Roses and lilies, mint and balm, lay on the floor of the deck like a carpet. She picked up a rose. "Is all this for me?"<br><br> "Everything is for you. By the by, Buckingham has tried to fast himself into the shape you last saw him wearing, but in truth, he resembles nothing so much as a pregnant sheep these days, doesn't he, Lieutenant Saylor? Tell her."<br><br> The Life Guard King Charles addressed smiled but was silent.<br><br> "Lieutenant Saylor has the gift of diplomacy."<br><br> The yacht had come in very fast to the shore, but it was large enough that it had to stop yards out. There was a harbor built, but it was dangerously silted with sand and shingle from the cliffs.<br><br> "I see my father. I'm certain of it," Alice said to Renee. She pointed to the group standing under a canopy with the queen. Alice felt as if her heart were going to fly out of her chest. "And there's Barbara." She stood to wave her arms. "Barbara!"<br><br> Efficiently, expertly, the Life Guards dropped the sails and the anchor, and the yacht stopped as obediently as a docile mare. The water was choppy and deep. Other young officers from the king's Life Guards standing on the shore walked into the water, then swam to the yacht. A rowboat was clumsily maneuvered close to its side.<br><br> "Your carriage awaits," said King Charles to his sister. "The harbor is silted up. This is the only way I can land you without wetting you."</p><h2>Hortus Eystettensis: The Bishop&#39;s Garden and Besler&#39;s Magnificent Book</h2><p>Hortus Eystettensis was published in 1613 to document a garden created by the Prince-Bishop of EichstStt which contained all the shrubs and flowering plants known at the time; 367 plates illustrate more than 1,000 species. It was printed from copper engravings in a very large format, and a few of the copies (no more than 25) were printed on special paper and individually hand-colored by teams of illuminators. One of these priceless volumes is owned by the British Library; and Barker, former deputy keeper there, set out to find the extant colored copies, compare them, and establish the full history of this monumental book. The text is accompanied by 80 full-page reproductions which, even in this oversize volume (12x15&#34;), are only half the size of the originals, and comparative details from the different copies.

And when dodging his fists doesn't work, B doesn't hesitate to take the piss out of kids at school with a few slaps or cruel remarks. <br>That is, until zombies attack the school. B is forced on a mad dash through the serpentine corridors of high school, making allegiances with anyone with enough gall to fight off their pursuers. <br></p><p>Darren Shan is the bestselling author of Cirque Du Freak, The Demonata, and the Saga of Larten Crepsley, as well as the stand-alone book <i>The Thin Executioner.</i> Shan's books are sold on almost every continent and in thirty-one languages, and have been bestsellers in countries including the US, Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Hungary, Japan, Taiwan, and the UAE. In total, they have sold over 25 million copies worldwide. Shan divides his time between his homes in Ireland and London.Gr 7-9-B Smith (gender not revealed until the end) is a punk, a bully, and a thug, easily falling into the trap of racism because of an overbearing father. B silently questions that ignorance but ultimately finds it easier, and safer, to conform to Dad's ideals rather than take a stand, as well as another beating. When the zombies attack, B is able to channel this aggression and anger and help lead fellow students trying to find a safe haven and escape. Finally, B's father comes to the rescue and, for a brief moment, all is well. An unfortunate choice, however, causes B's fragile faith to crumble and even worse tragedy ensues. B's self-loathing and doubt make this more than just your average zombie tale, and the subject will strike a chord with many teens, especially those who may find themselves at odds with the beliefs of their parents. Once the zombies attack, however, the soul-searching is put to rest and the action comes fast, furious, and relatively gory. This is the first book in a 12-volume series (with other titles being released at a projected rate of four a year), and it leaves plenty of questions unresolved. This is a promising beginning, and it's sure to have teens eagerly anticipating the next installment.-Erik Knapp, Davis Library, Plano, TX&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Beatrice Bordeaux was looking forward to a summer of reigniting the passion between her and her husband, Harry. Instead, tasked with furthering his investment interest in Montauk as a resort destination, she learns she&#x2019;ll be spending twelve weeks sequestered with the high society wives at The Montauk Manor&#x2015;a two-hundred room seaside hotel&#x2015;while Harry pursues other interests in the city. </p><p>College educated, but raised a modest country girl in Pennsylvania, Bea has never felt fully comfortable among these privileged women, whose days are devoted not to their children but to leisure activities and charities that seemingly benefit no one but themselves. She longs to be a mother herself, as well as a loving wife, but after five years of marriage she remains childless while Harry is increasingly remote and distracted. Despite lavish parties at the Manor and the Yacht Club, Bea is lost and lonely and befriends the manor&#x2019;s laundress whose work ethic and family life stir memories of who she once was. </p><p>As she drifts further from the society women and their preoccupations and closer toward Montauk&#x2019;s natural beauty and community spirit, Bea finds herself drawn to a man nothing like her husband &#x2013;stoic, plain spoken and enigmatic. Inspiring a strength and courage she had almost forgotten, his presence forces her to face a haunting tragedy of her past and question her future. </p><p>Desperate to embrace moments of happiness, no matter how fleeting, she soon discovers that such moments may be all she has, when fates conspire to tear her world apart...</p></p><p>Born in England, <b>Nicola Harrison</b> moved to CA where she received a BA in Literature at UCLA before moving to NYC and earning an MFA in creative writing at Stony Brook.

Men and newly emancipated women alike rejected pre-war values and moral restraints. They embraced new lifestyles, and discovered a lust for extravagance, partying, and erotic experimentation that had the inter-war era known as the Roaring Twenties, or the "mad years," and Paris as the City of Pleasure. In this uncensored and fascinating photographic record of the period, historian Alexandre Dupouy pulls backs the bedcovers on Paris&#x2019;s eye-opening erotic life, revealing the delights of its fetish scene, its licensed brothels and gay nightclubs, the first sex shop chains, erotic photography, pornography, and much more. This is an uncensored, titillating, and utterly fascinating look at the sexual excesses of the inter-war period in what was the world&#x2019;s most decadent city.</p><p><b>Alexandre Dupouy</b> is a bookseller and collector who has been a leading authority on under-the-counter culture for almost 50 years, and has written and contributed to numerous books in his native France. He is the proud owner of the Parisian emporium Larmes d'�ros.</p><h2>Wolf Hall: A Novel (Wolf Hall Trilogy, 1)</h2><p><p><b>In the ruthless arena of King Henry VIII's court, only one man dares to gamble his life to win the king's favor and ascend to the heights of political power</b></p><p>England in the 1520s is a heartbeat from disaster. If the king dies without a male heir, the country could be destroyed by civil war. Henry VIII wants to annul his marriage of twenty years, and marry Anne Boleyn. The pope and most of Europe opposes him. The quest for the king's freedom destroys his adviser, the brilliant Cardinal Wolsey, and leaves a power vacuum. </p><p>Into this impasse steps Thomas Cromwell. Cromwell is a wholly original man, a charmer and a bully, both idealist and opportunist, astute in reading people and a demon of energy: he is also a consummate politician, hardened by his personal losses, implacable in his ambition. But Henry is volatile: one day tender, one day murderous. Cromwell helps him break the opposition, but what will be the price of his triumph? </p><p>In inimitable style, Hilary Mantel presents a picture of a half-made society on the cusp of change, where individuals fight or embrace their fate with passion and courage. With a vast array of characters, overflowing with incident, the novel re-creates an era when the personal and political are separated by a hairbreadth, where success brings unlimited power but a single failure means death.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, October 2009:</strong> No character in the canon has been writ larger than Henry VIII, but that didn't stop Hilary Mantel. She strides through centuries, past acres of novels, histories, biographies, and plays--even past Henry himself--confident in the knowledge that to recast history's most mercurial sovereign, it's not the King she needs to see, but one of the King's most mysterious agents. Enter Thomas Cromwell, a self-made man and remarkable polymath who ascends to the King's right hand. Rigorously pragmatic and forward-thinking, Cromwell has little interest in what motivates his Majesty, and although he makes way for Henry's marriage to the infamous Anne Boleyn, it's the future of a free England that he honors above all else and hopes to secure. Mantel plots with a sleight of hand, making full use of her masterful grasp on the facts without weighing down her prose. The opening cast of characters and family trees may give initial pause to some readers, but persevere: the witty, whip-smart lines volleying the action forward may convince you a short stay in the Tower of London might not be so bad... provided you could bring a copy of <em>Wolf Hall</em> along. --<em>Anne Bartholomew</em><p><b>Hilary Mantel</b> is the two-time winner of the Man Booker Prize for her best-selling novel <i>Wolf Hall</i> and its sequel, <i>Bring Up the Bodies</i>.

Rivers like the Walbrook, the Fleet or the Westbourne have left their mark on the city, and still form an important part of our subterranean world.<br> David Fathers traces the course of twelve hidden rivers in a series of detailed guided walks, illustrating the traces they have left and showing the ways they have shaped the city. Each walk starts at the tube or rail station nearest to the source of the river, and then follows it down to the Thames through parkland, suburbia, historic neighbourhoods and the vestiges of our industrial past. Along the way there are encounters with such extraordinary Londoners as William Blake, Judy Garland, Paul Robeson, Terence Donovan, Bradley Wiggins, Nelson, Lenin, Freud, and the great Victorian engineer Joseph Bazalgette.<br><i>Hidden Rivers of London </i>contains over 120 km of walks, both north and south of the Thames.

Having lived in London for over thirty years, he is slightly embarrassed to admit that he only discovered the subject of his first book, The Regent's Canal, a few years ago. The success of that first book has led to The London Thames Walk and Hidden Rivers of London (June 2017).</p>'This book completes an aquatic trilogy that is so accomplished, we half expect to see a cover endorsement from Old Father Thames himself...

They watched the pale light of the early morning sun push back the darkness with slow, careful deliberation.</p><p>&#x201c;Where is he?&#x201d; the young man asked.</p><p>His father did not look his way. &#x201c;He has not left his chamber since he gave the order.&#x201d;</p><p>The young man ran a hand through his wavy hair, exhaling all the while. &#x201c;There will be riots in the city streets for this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you will put them to rout, in short order.&#x201d; It was a terse response, still made to a somber stretch of light.</p><p>&#x201c;In short order? Do you not think a mother and father, regardless of birth or rank, will fight to avenge their child?&#x201d;</p><p>Finally, the father faced his son. His eyes were drawn and sunken, as though a weight tugged at them from within. &#x201c;They will fight. They should fight. And you will ensure it amounts to nothing. You will do your duty to your king. Do you understand?&#x201d;</p><p>The young man paused. &#x201c;I understand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;General al-Khoury?&#x201d;</p><p>His father turned toward the soldier standing behind them. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is done.&#x201d;</p><p>His father nodded, and the soldier left.</p><p>Again, the two men stared up at the sky.</p><p>Waiting.</p><p>A drop of rain struck the arid surface beneath their feet, disappearing into the tan stone. Another plinked against the iron railing before it slid its way into nothingness.</p><p>Soon, rain was falling around them at a steady pace.</p><p>&#x201c;There is your proof,&#x201d; the general said, his voice laden with quiet anguish.</p><p>The young man did not respond right away.</p><p>&#x201c;He cannot withstand this, Father.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He can. He is strong.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You have never understood Khalid. It is not about strength. It is about substance. What follows will destroy all that remains of his, leaving behind a husk&#x2014;a shadow of what he once was.&#x201d;</p><p>The general winced. &#x201c;Do you think I wanted this for him? I would drown in my own blood to prevent this. But we have no choice.&#x201d;</p><p>The young man shook his head and wiped the rain from beneath his chin.</p><p>&#x201c;I refuse to believe that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jalal&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There must be another way.&#x201d; With that, the young man turned from the railing and vanished down the staircase.</p><p>Throughout the city, long-dry wells began to fill. Cracked, sunbaked cisterns shimmered with pools of hope, and the people of Rey awoke to a new joy. They raced into the streets, angling their smiling faces to the sky.</p><p>Not knowing the price.</p><p>And, deep within the palace of marble and stone, a boy of eighteen sat alone before a table of polished ebony&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Listening to the rain.</p><p>The only light in the room reflected back in his amber eyes.</p><p>A light beset by the dark.</p><p>He braced his elbows on his knees and made a crown of his hands about his brow. Then he shuttered his gaze, and the words echoed around him, filling his ears with the promise of a life rooted in the past.</p><p>Of a life atoning for his sins.</p><p><i>One hundred lives for the one you took. One life to one dawn. Should you fail but a single morn, I shall take from you your dreams. I shall take from you your city.</i></p><p><i>And I shall take from you these lives, a thousandfold.</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>THEY WERE NOT GENTLE. AND WHY SHOULD THEY BE?</p><p>After all, they did not expect her to live past the next morning.</p><p>The hands that tugged ivory combs through Shahrzad&#x2019;s waist-length hair and scrubbed sandalwood paste on her bronze arms did so with a brutal kind of detachment.</p><p>Shahrzad watched one young servant girl dust her bare shoulders with flakes of gold that caught the light from the setting sun.</p><p>A breeze gusted along the gossamer curtains lining the walls of the chamber. The sweet scent of citrus blossoms wafted through the carved wooden screens leading to the terrace, whispering of a freedom now beyond reach.</p><p><i>This was my choice. Remember Shiva.</i></p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t wear necklaces,&#x201d; Shahrzad said when another girl began to fasten a jewel-encrusted behemoth around her throat.</p><p>&#x201c;It is a gift from the caliph. You must wear it, my lady.&#x201d;</p><p>Shahrzad stared down at the slight girl in amused disbelief. &#x201c;And if I don&#x2019;t? Will he kill me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please, my lady, I&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Shahrzad sighed. &#x201c;I suppose now is not the time to make this point.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, my lady.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My name is Shahrzad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know, my lady.&#x201d; The girl glanced away in discomfort before turning to assist with Shahrzad&#x2019;s gilded mantle. As the two young women eased the weighty garment onto her glittering shoulders, Shahrzad studied the finished product in the mirror before her.</p><p>Her midnight tresses gleamed like polished obsidian, and her hazel eyes were edged in alternating strokes of black kohl and liquid gold. At the center of her brow hung a teardrop ruby the size of her thumb; its mate dangled from a thin chain around her bare waist, grazing the silk sash of her trowsers. The mantle itself was pale damask and threaded with silver and gold in an intricate pattern that grew ever chaotic as it flared by her feet.</p><p><i>I look like a gilded peacock.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Do they all look this ridiculous?&#x201d; Shahrzad asked.</p><p>Again, the two young women averted their gazes with unease.</p><p><i>I&#x2019;m sure Shiva didn&#x2019;t look this ridiculous&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>Shahrzad&#x2019;s expression hardened.</p><p><i>Shiva would have looked beautiful. Beautiful and strong.</i></p><p>Her fingernails dug into her palms; tiny crescents of steely resolve.</p><p>At the sound of a quiet knock at the door, three heads turned&#x2014;their collective breaths bated.</p><p>In spite of her newfound mettle, Shahrzad&#x2019;s heart began to pound.</p><p>&#x201c;May I come in?&#x201d; The soft voice of her father broke through the silence, pleading and laced in tacit apology.</p><p>Shahrzad exhaled slowly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. carefully.</p><p>&#x201c;Baba, what are you doing here?&#x201d; Her words were patient, yet wary.</p><p>Jahandar al-Khayzuran shuffled into the chamber. His beard and temples were streaked with grey, and the myriad colors in his hazel eyes shimmered and shifted like the sea in the midst of a storm.</p><p>In his hand was a single budding rose, its center leached of color, and the tips of its petals tinged a beautiful, blushing mauve.</p><p>&#x201c;Where is Irsa?&#x201d; Shahrzad asked, alarm seeping into her tone.</p><p>Her father smiled sadly. &#x201c;She is at home. I did not allow her to come with me, though she fought and raged until the last possible moment.&#x201d;</p><p><i>At least in this he has not ignored my wishes.</i></p><p>&#x201c;You should be with her. She needs you tonight. Please do this for me, Baba? Do as we discussed?&#x201d; She reached out and took his free hand, squeezing tightly, beseeching him in her grip to follow the plans she had laid out in the days before.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2014;I can&#x2019;t, my child.&#x201d; Jahandar lowered his head, a sob rising in his chest, his thin shoulders trembling with grief. &#x201c;Shahrzad&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Be strong. For Irsa. I promise you, everything will be fine.&#x201d; Shahrzad raised her palm to his weathered face and brushed away the smattering of tears from his cheek.</p><p>&#x201c;I cannot. The thought that this may be your last sunset&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It will not be the last. I will see tomorrow&#x2019;s sunset. This I swear to you.&#x201d;</p><p>Jahandar nodded, his misery nowhere close to mollified. He held out the rose in his hand. &#x201c;The last from my garden; it has not yet bloomed fully, but I wanted to give you one remembrance of home.&#x201d;</p><p>She smiled as she reached for it, the love between them far past mere gratitude, but he stopped her. When she realized the reason, she began to protest.</p><p>&#x201c;No. At least in this, I might do something for you,&#x201d; he muttered, almost to himself. He stared at the rose, his brow furrowed and his mouth drawn. One servant girl coughed in her fist while the other looked to the floor.</p><p>Shahrzad waited patiently. Knowingly.</p><p>The rose started to unfurl. Its petals twisted open, prodded to life by an invisible hand. As it expanded, a delicious perfume filled the space between them, sweet and perfect for an instant&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but soon, it became overpowering. Cloying. The edges of the flower changed from a brilliant, deep pink to a shadowy rust in the blink of an eye.</p><p>And then the flower began to wither and die.</p><p>Dismayed, Jahandar watched its dried petals wilt to the white marble at their feet.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2014;I&#x2019;m sorry, Shahrzad,&#x201d; he cried.</p><p>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter. I will never forget how beautiful it was for that moment, Baba.&#x201d; She wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him close. By his ear, in a voice so low only he could hear, she said, &#x201c;Go to Tariq, as you promised. Take Irsa and go.&#x201d;</p><p>He nodded, his eyes shimmering once more. &#x201c;I love you, my child.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I love you. I will keep my promises. All of them.&#x201d;</p><p>Overcome, Jahandar blinked down at his elder daughter in silence.</p><p>This time, the knock at the door demanded attention rather than requested it.</p><p>Shahrzad&#x2019;s forehead whipped back in its direction, the bloodred ruby swinging in tandem. She squared her shoulders and lifted her pointed chin.</p><p>Jahandar stood to the side, covering his face with his hands, as his daughter marched forward.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry&#x2014;so very sorry,&#x201d; she whispered to him before striding across the threshold to follow the contingent of guards leading the processional. Jahandar slid to his knees and sobbed as Shahrzad turned the corner and disappeared.</p><p>With her father&#x2019;s grief resounding through the halls, Shahrzad&#x2019;s feet refused to carry her but a few steps down the cavernous corridors of the palace. She halted, her knees shaking beneath the thin silk of her voluminous <i>sirwal</i> trowsers.</p><p>&#x201c;My lady?&#x201d; one of the guards prompted in a bored tone.</p><p>&#x201c;He can wait,&#x201d; Shahrzad gasped.</p><p>The guards exchanged glances.</p><p>Her own tears threatening to blaze a telltale trail down her cheeks, Shahrzad pressed a hand to her chest. Unwittingly, her fingertips brushed the edge of the thick gold necklace clasped around her throat, festooned with gems of outlandish size and untold variety. It felt heavy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. stifling. Like a bejeweled fetter. She allowed her fingers to wrap around the offending instrument, thinking for a moment to rip it from her body.</p><p>The rage was comforting. A friendly reminder.</p><p><i>Shiva.</i></p><p>Her dearest friend. Her closest confidante.</p><p>She curled her toes within their sandals of braided bullion and threw back her shoulders once more. Without a word, she resumed her march.</p><p>Again, the guards looked to one another for an instant.</p><p>When they reached the massive double doors leading into the throne room, Shahrzad realized her heart was racing at twice its normal speed. The doors swung open with a distended groan, and she focused on her target, ignoring all else around her.</p><p>At the very end of the immense space stood Khalid Ibn al-Rashid, the Caliph of Khorasan.</p><p>The King of Kings.</p><p><i>The monster from my nightmares.</i></p><p>With every step she took, Shahrzad felt the hate rise in her blood, along with the clarity of purpose. She stared at him, her eyes never wavering. His proud carriage stood out amongst the men in his retinue, and details began to emerge the closer she drew to his side.</p><p>He was tall and trim, with the build of a young man proficient in warfare. His dark hair was straight and styled in a manner suggesting a desire for order in all things.</p><p>As she strode onto the dais, she looked up at him, refusing to balk, even in the face of her king.</p><p>His thick eyebrows raised a fraction. They framed eyes so pale a shade of brown they appeared amber in certain flashes of light, like those of a tiger. His profile was an artist&#x2019;s study in angles, and he remained motionless as he returned her watchful scrutiny.</p><p>A face that cut; a gaze that pierced.</p><p>He reached a hand out to her.</p><p>Just as she extended her palm to grasp it, she remembered to bow.</p><p>The wrath seethed below the surface, bringing a flush to her cheeks.</p><p>When she met his eyes again, he blinked once.</p><p>&#x201c;Wife.&#x201d; He nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;My king.&#x201d;</p><p><i>I will live to see tomorrow&#x2019;s sunset.

Soon, the sound of clattering hooves drew near, a swirl of sand curling in its wake.</p><p>The two riders paused a respectful distance from the falcon and her kill.</p><p>With the sun at his back, the first rider, sitting astride a gleaming, dark bay al-Khamsa stallion, extended his left arm and whistled, low and soft.</p><p>The falcon twisted his way, her yellow-rimmed eyes narrowing. Then she took to the air once more and landed with her talons firmly embedded in the leather <i>mankalah</i> cuff bound from the rider&#x2019;s wrist to his elbow.</p><p>&#x201c;Curse you, Zoraya. I lost another bet,&#x201d; the second rider groaned to the bird.</p><p>The falconer grinned at Rahim, his friend since childhood. &#x201c;Stop complaining.

Hold this.&#x201d; Tariq stretched out his forearm, with Zoraya still waiting patiently on her perch. When the falcon realized she was being passed along to Rahim, she ruffled her feathers and screeched in protest.</p><p>Rahim reared back with alarm. &#x201c;That godforsaken bird hates me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because she&#x2019;s a good judge of character.&#x201d; Tariq smiled.</p><p>&#x201c;With a temper for the ages,&#x201d; Rahim grumbled. &#x201c;Honestly, she&#x2019;s worse than Shazi.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Another girl with excellent taste.&#x201d;</p><p>Rahim rolled his eyes. &#x201c;A bit self-serving in that assessment, don&#x2019;t you think?

Now, stop wasting time and get down from that blasted roan so we can go home.&#x201d;</p><p>Under continued grumblings, Rahim dismounted from his grey Akhal-Teke&#x2014;her mane shining like polished pewter in the desert sun.</p><p>Tariq&#x2019;s eyes skimmed the stretch of sand and dry brushwood along the horizon.

She lives in Toronto, Canada.PreSchool-K-This colorful picture book is a vehicle lover's dream-a whole alphabet of automobiles, trucks, machinery, and road signs. From "Ambulance" to "Zamboni," each page has a lower- and uppercase letter displayed, plus a car, etc., to match, and a description and illustration that emphasize the spotlighted letter. The lively text frequently includes onomatopoeic words. For example, a dump truck "thunders by with its load, stops and tips it on the ground. Clatter, crash, ka-Boom!" The book is stunningly illustrated in a deceptively simple stylized manner. Featuring bright primary colors, the pages are packed with people and vehicles in action. The endpapers present the lower- and uppercase alphabet plus all the familiar road signs. The cover flap directs children to the illustrator's Web site for related activities, including a truck cutout, road sign stickers, bookplates, and bookmarks that can be downloaded.

With a deft use of multiple perspectives, he has rewritten a chapter in the history of the Old South. His book will do much to freshen stale ways of thinking about a valiant people.'<br><br>-Charles Hudson, author of The Southeastern Indians</p><p>Joel W. Martin is associate professor of religious studies and American studies at Franklin and Marshall College.In a compelling counterpoint to viewing colonial Indian-white relations as a series of uneven battles or unfair massacres, author Martin traces the cultural/religious history of the Muskogee "Creeks" from precontact times, through a century of nation-to-nation dealings with European traders, to a culmination of this interaction in the 1814 revolt against the U.S. Army at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. Placed in a Muskogee context, this revolt is more than an uprising against white encroachment; it is the culmination of an ongoing effort by the Muskogees for cultural reaffirmation. Part of a growing body of literature in which Native Americans are viewed as dynamic participants in the events that encompass their worlds, this is an important contribution to U.S. history collections.<br><i>-Mary B.

For years, experts have argued over the tiny details of exactly how they do what they do, and how their various components interact. What's undeniable is that, far more than being just a &#x201c;loudness booster &#x201d; the unique combination of tubes, capacitors, resistors, and transformers in these amps can contribute enormously to the quality of sound derived from any electric guitar. In this thorough and authoritative book, Dave Hunter cuts through the marketing hyperbole, and the blind faith, and supplies all the information you need to choose the right amp, and get the best from it. The book also features exclusively conducted, in-depth interviews with leading figures in the tube amp-building world &#x2013; including Ken Fischer, Mark Sampson, and Michael Zaite &#x2013; and even provides full instructions on how to construct your own high-quality tube guitar amp from scratch.</p><p>Dave Hunter, author of Guitar Effects Pedals, is an American musician and journalist who has worked in both Britain and the USA. His is a former editor of The Guitar Magazine (UK&#39;), &#39;has contributed to TV and radio documentaries, and has edited and contributed to books such as: Acoustic Guitars - The Illustrated Encyclopedia; The Tube Amp Book - Deluxe Revised Edition; Guitar - A Complete Guide for the Player; and Recording Guitar and Bass. He lives in Portsmouth, NH.&#39;&#39;The Guitar Amp Handbook by Dave Hunter (who has written many a book on guitars) covers everything you need to know about the sought after tube amplifier. There is a very heavy warning on page seven about the danger of opening up an amplifier so I read this book for interest only, rather than intending to get a screwdriver out. Well laid out with detailed chapters on how an amp works plus an assortment of classic amp descriptions, the book then continues on how to choose the best amp for you and how to look after it. Essentially, a one-stop shop for all things Marshall, Fender and Peavey.&#39;&#39; --Fireworks Magazine</p><h2>Big Bill Blues</h2><p>Big Bill Broonzy (1893-1958) was one of the masters of the country blues. His vocal style was legendary long before his death, and his songs, including &#34;Big Bill Blues&#34;, &#34;Keys to the Highway&#34;, and &#34;Looking Up at Down&#34;, are some of the best known in the blues repertoire. His 1955 autobiography, &#34;Big Bill Blues&#34;, was the first - and only - book ever written by a country blues musician. It captures the full flavour of Broonzy&#39;s unique voice as he tells about his thirty years of playing the blues.

On the other hand, the brain: a three-pound blob. For thousands of years, few people saw a connection between the two. In 1652, the English philosopher Henry More flatly stated that the brain "shows no more capacity for thought than a cake of suet or a bowl of curds." Today, of course, it's clear that the brain is far more than goop. Electricity and neurotransmitters shuttle among its billions of neurons, producing our passions, reasoning and consciousness. Yet most of us still have trouble feeling a link between the details of the brain -- its oligodendrites, its nodes of Ranvier, its alpha-2A noradrenergic receptors -- and our own existence.<p> In recent years this chasm has attracted a corps of bridge-builders. They have packed shelves with books that try to link neuroscience to every aspect of our lives. The latest addition is An Alchemy of Mind, by Diane Ackerman. In some ways Ackerman's book is not much different from the rest. She surveys the same well-traveled territories, with chapters on topics such as consciousness, language and the mental differences between the sexes. If you keep up with brain research news in The Washington Post, there won't be many scientific surprises for you here. But Ackerman is unusual in that she writes not as a scientist or a science journalist. Instead, she's a poet (albeit a poet with a remarkable appetite for journals with names like Cerebrum). And it's as a poet that she shows her greatest strengths in writing on the brain, as well as her greatest weaknesses.</p><p> Ackerman knows that poetry and fiction are full of profound insights into the workings of the mind. She knows how to pluck a passage out of Proust, Shakespeare or Virginia Woolf to illustrate a point. In some cases she chooses instead to lyrically recall an experience of her own (such as her personal experience with the blending of sensation known as synesthesia). But she also knows that literature can illuminate that mind in a different way. The mark of a great author is the ability to bootstrap language to higher levels of meaning with the help of symbols, metaphors and figures of speech. And the brain, at its most basic level of information-processing, depends on a similar sort of poetic bootstrapping. It doesn't passively reproduce the sensations that enter its neurons as into a pinhole camera. Instead, it grabs a limited number of details and then builds around them an elaborate hypothesis about the world. "We are all unwitting poets," Ackerman says.</p><p> Ackerman spends much of An Alchemy of Mind turning her metaphor-making neurons back on themselves to find captivating ways to describe how the brain works. Heaven knows neuroscience could use an infusion of poetry. When scientists (and science writers) try to describe the brain to the public, they are too easily satisfied with feeble metaphors. Receptors are locks, for example, and neurotransmitters are keys. Yet keys and locks are rigid, as Ackerman points out, while receptors and neurotransmitters are yielding and floppy. Someone needs to find a new metaphor, and she offers some that are both evocative and meaningful, as when she refers to short-term memory as a "mental scratch pad." But too often she offers mud instead of light.</p><p>"Most children don't remember much before the age of two or three," she informs us, "because the cortex develops slowly and the brain hasn't activated its thinking cap yet." Thinking cap? What exactly does that mean? You can scour an entire neurology textbook and still not be able to answer that question. Describing how music is encoded in memory, Ackerman writes about neurons producing proteins "which then return to the synapse where the music was being processed and glue that music to the site." A miniature jukebox now dangles from a nerve, making us none the wiser.</p><p> A bad metaphor can do more than just befuddle. It can give a reader precisely the wrong idea about how nature works. Those who hope to learn the basics about the brain in An Alchemy of Mind will sometimes be misled by pretty-sounding language. Ackerman informs us, for example, that our ancestors were faced with the paradox of getting a big human brain out of a mother's narrow birth canal. "The solution we found was to give birth earlier," she declares, as if our ancestors convened a meeting where they voted to redesign their genome. Still, Ackerman deserves credit for taking on what is an important mission -- a mission that is, at least for the moment, doomed to failure.</p><p> She's right when she says that "no image English offers -- say, of dominoes, ricochets, echoes, or ripples -- can capture how in the brain everything affects everything else all at once, or how our everythingness always lingers in mind as we engage the everythingness of everyone else." Despite the shortcomings of our ideas and our language, we must keep searching for new ways to express the workings of the brain. It is in those images, more and more, that we see ourselves. </p><p></p><p>Reviewed by Carl Zimmer</p><p></p><p>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

In <i>Piano Notes,</i> a finalist for a 2003 National Book Critics Circle Award, Charles Rosen, one of the world's most talented pianists, distills a lifetime of wisdom and lore into an unforgettable tour of the hidden world of piano playing. <br> You'll read about how a note is produced, why a chord can move us, why the piano -- "hero and villain" of tonality -- has shaped the course of Western music, and why it is growing obsolete. Rosen explains what it means that Beethoven composed in his head whereas Mozart would never dream of doing so, why there are no <i>fortissimos</i> in the works of Ravel, and why a piano player's acrobatics have an important dramatic effect but nothing more. Ending on a contemplative note, <i>Piano Notes</i> offers an elegant argument that piano music "is not just sound or even significant sound" but a mechanical, physical, and fetishistic experience that faces new challenges in an era of recorded music. Rosen ponders whether piano playing will ever again be the same, and his insights astonish.</p><p><b>Charles Rosen</b> is a concert pianist and music critic. He has twice been nominated for the Grammy Award, and his landmark book, <i>The Classical Style,</i> won the National Book Award. He lives in New York City and Paris.<b>Prelude</b> <p> This is a book about the experience of playing the piano. It is not an autobiography, although I have had to draw on some personal anecdotes, but it concerns the experience of playing relevant to all pianists, amateur as well as professional. What has interested me most of all is the relation of the physical act of playing to those aspects of music generally considered more intellectual, spiritual, and emotional, the different ways that body and spirit interact. I have concentrated mostly on professional experience since I know it best, and also because the amateur ideal today is largely derived from the professional standard, but I write for listeners as well as pianists. I have certainly not attempted to tell pianists how they must play. Although my own prejudices have naturally intruded, I have at least tried to keep them under control. There are many valid approaches to the instrument and to its repertoire -- and if I occasionally find some approaches invalid, I am not stiff-necked about them, and not wedded permanently to my opinions. I have been most intent on conveying the variety of experience of playing, its torments and its delights. </p><p> The temptation is great to write inspirational prose in the grand style about an experience as intense as playing is for any committed pianist. I am embarrassed when I read that kind of prose, however, as the intensity of feeling is only made factitious by being diluted with words, so I have largely preferred to let that intensity be taken for granted. I adore the grand style and I am intrigued by grand synthetic theories, but I am suspicious of teachers who claim to have invented the only successful method for bringing out the best in young performers, of theorists who claim to have invented the unique approach to analysis, and of historians who wish to reduce all the developments of the musical style of the past entirely to the determinism of social conditions. Of course, the place of music in society influences the way we listen and play, but there are so many cases when a composer or pianist produces work badly fitted to the conditions of his or her own time but that turns out for some few contemporaries and then for a later period to be of great value. I have also attempted to discuss the constraints that cause pianists to play in ways to which they are not really committed, and have ventured to speculate briefly on the decisive role the instrument has played in both the history of composition and the reception of music today. Above all, I have tried to become more aware myself of the powerful and peculiar motives that drive some of us to the piano instead of to the violin, the guitar, or the record-player, and of the odd difficulties that this decision creates in our lives. </p><p> Copyright � 2002 by Charles Rosen</p></p><h2>Last Night at the Blue Angel: A Novel</h2><p><p>Set against the backdrop of the early 1960s Chicago jazz scene, a highly ambitious and stylish literary debut that combines the atmosphere and period detail of Amor Towles&#x2019; <em>Rules of Civility</em> with the emotional depth and drama of <em>The Memory Keeper's Daughter</em>, about a talented but troubled singer, her precocious ten-year-old daughter, and their heartbreaking relationship.</p><p>It is the early 1960s, and Chicago is a city of uneasy tensions&#x2014;segregation, sexual experimentation, free love, the Cold War&#x2014;but it is also home to one of the country&#x2019;s most vibrant jazz scenes. Naomi Hill, a singer at the Blue Angel club, has been poised on the brink of stardom for nearly ten years. Finally, her big break arrives&#x2014;the cover of <em>Look</em> magazine. But success has come at enormous personal cost. Beautiful and magnetic, Naomi is a fiercely ambitious yet extremely self-destructive woman whose charms are irresistible and dangerous for those around her. No one knows this better than Sophia, her clever ten-year-old daughter.</p><p>For Sophia, Naomi is the center of her universe. As the only child of a single, unconventional mother, growing up in an adult world, Sophia has seen things beyond her years and her understanding. Unsettled by her uncertain home life, she harbors the terrible fear that the world could end at any moment, and compulsively keeps a running list of practical objects she will need to reinvent once nuclear catastrophe strikes. Her one constant is Jim, the photographer who is her best friend, surrogate father, and protector. But Jim is deeply in love with Naomi&#x2014;a situation that adds to Sophia&#x2019;s anxiety.</p><p>Told from the alternating perspectives of Sophia and Naomi, their powerful and wrenching story unfolds in layers, revealing Sophia&#x2019;s struggle for her mother&#x2019;s love with Naomi&#x2019;s desperate journey to stardom and the colorful cadre of close friends who shaped her along the way.</p><p>Sophisticated yet poignant, <em>Last Night at the Blue Angel</em> is an unforgettable tale about what happens when our passion for the life we want is at sharp odds with the life we have. It is a story ripe with surprising twists and revelations, and an ending that is bound to break your heart.</p></p><p>Paula McLain Rebecca Rotert <p><b></b></p><b>Paula McLain, author of the New York Times best-selling <i>The Paris Wife</i>, interviews Rebecca Rotert</b><p></p> <p><b>Paula McLain (PM): </b>From page one, I felt you really knew your story and these fascinating characters inside and out, Rebecca. What hooked you and got you writing this novel? </p><p><b>Rebecca Rotert (RR): </b>Sophia&#x2019;s voice appeared first and I immediately fell in love with her sensibility, her hyper-vigilance. Her mother, Naomi, demands an enormous amount of attention, and Sophia lives in the shadow of that appetite, like a riverbank constantly being shaped and re-shaped by Naomi&#x2019;s currents. You could also say I&#x2019;ve been thinking about this theme all my life. I was acutely aware from an early age of my own mother&#x2019;s magnetism. In a way, the brighter she shone, the more private I got to be, and in that privacy my own internal world began &#x2013; the reading, writing, painting, and music. </p><p><b> PM:</b> As troubled, unpredictable and self-involved as Naomi is, I felt I understood her demons and history&#x2014;what drives her. As her creator, you clearly found sympathy for her too. How?</p><p><b>RR: </b>It&#x2019;s tempting to see a troubled character as fixed, her actions as calculated. I think this is rarely the case. Once the larger narrative of a life comes into view, even the worst behavior begins to make sense. It&#x2019;s always a risk to give space to less desirable characters but it&#x2019;s infinitely more interesting. </p><p><b> PM:</b> The descriptions of singing, listening to and performing songs are incredibly well done and feel true to life. What&#x2019;s your own relationship to music?</p><p><b> RR:</b> My family sings a LOT. I was classically trained, and sang in school choirs and plays. As a young adult I sang in a few bands and learned to write music, to show up at practice with lyrics and chords on a scrap of paper and have a song by the end of the night. I chose to limit Naomi&#x2019;s artistry to singing other people&#x2019;s music as another way for her self-expression to be truncated. If she wrote her own music, if she had that kind of agency, her story would be different, I think. </p><p><b> PM:</b> I loved Jim! He&#x2019;s the father Sophia would choose if she were able, and is the emotional glue for Naomi too. How can he remain so devoted when she&#x2019;s put him through the wringer? Did you know from the start what a significant role he would come to play in the novel? </p><p><b>RR:</b> I love Jim, too. He is the good guy, the &#x201c;friend,&#x201d; but I wanted to represent this relationship as a sort of performance, too. It&#x2019;s not until both Jim and Naomi stop performing their designated roles &#x2013; adorer, beloved - that they see each other clearly. I didn&#x2019;t realize how catalytic Jim would become until researching the photographer, Richard Nickel, on whom he is loosely based. Nickel&#x2019;s commitment to a lost cause was beautiful and tragic. Through Jim, I wanted to pay homage, however small and impressionistic, to Nickel.</p><p><b>PM:</b> Sophia is raised by a colorful, unconventional family that somehow works just the same. Can you speak to what inspired Sister Eye, the other nuns, and the fabulous Rita? </p><p><b>RR:</b> These characters were gleaned from my life. I had one particular teacher who treated me with an undeserved and seemingly endless amount of patience and respect, and stood by me through my development as a writer as well as countless personal difficulties. I also believe that nuns are among the smartest, fiercest, most radical women I&#x2019;ll ever know&#x2014;and Rita is surely a tribute to all the fearless characters in my life.</p> <p><b></b></p><p></p> <p><b></b></p><p></p> <br> <p><b></b></p><p></p><p>It is the early 1960s, and Chicago is teeming with the tensions of the day&#x2014;segregation, sexual experimentation, the Cold War, and Vietnam&#x2014;but it is also home to some of the country's most influential jazz.

Hey, do you like questions? Questions are cool. They come in several fl avors. Of course, there are the boring questions: Who was the thirteenth president of the United States? What is the state bird of Montana? Then there are those corny questions called riddles: Why did the chicken cross the playground? Answer: To get to the other slide. There are also the head-scratching, noggin-tickling questions: Why do people drive on a parkway but park on a driveway? Why does &#39;after dark&#39; occur after light? Why are whales still chubby after all that swimming? Why don&#39;t sheep shrink in the rain? Why do cameras have round lenses but take square pictures? Why does night fall but day break? Why is one of the hottest dishes called &#39;chili&#39;? Why are many people afraid of heights, but no one is afraid of widths? Those questions probably have answers, but who cares? They&#39;re more interesting the way they are, don&#39;t you think? Then there are questions that do have answers. For example, do you ever stand on the beach and wonder how the moon way up there causes all those waves way down here? Or how long it would take to travel to another galaxy? You could get those answers without much problem. That&#39;s why there&#39;s science. The kind of science called physics would tell you about the moon and tides. Astronomy would tell you about how long to plan for an intergalactic vacation. Big-league questions Then there are those questions that everyone wonders about at some time or another: How did this world get here? Is there a God? Which religion is true? In case you&#39;re interested, a book called The Case for a Creator worked on the God question. Another one called The Case for Christ covered questions about Jesus, such as: Was he really the Son of God? Could he really have risen from the dead? This book is filled with big-league questions about believing in God and following Christ. Even a lot of Christians wonder about these noggin-nibblers: If God is good, why does he let bad things happen in the world? Do miracles happen or does science prove they are impossible? Is Jesus the only way to get into heaven? What about other religions? If I have questions or doubts, does that mean I&#39;m not a Christian? Herbivorous: an animal that only eats plants. They&#39;re vegetarians --- no burgers for them! Why ask in the first place? Those are some brain-drainers, and that&#39;s a . . . well, a no-brainer. People ask these questions all the time, and why shouldn&#39;t they? The answers are very important. It&#39;s only natural that folks would wonder. One more question: Should people who already believe in God ask for answers? If they wonder, for instance, whether God is really fair, does that mean they don&#39;t trust God enough? Should they just ignore the tough stuff and go on believing in God? No, because questions are too pesky to let us do that. They have a way of hanging around like stray cats in your neighborhood. If you pay even a little bit of attention to a stray, he&#39;ll keep showing up at your door. If you pay a little attention to an important question, it&#39;ll keep showing up in your mind. Here&#39;s an example. Don&#39;t think of a green-striped hippo. Go ahead --- try not to think of a massive, blubbery, herbivorous, four-toed aquatic artiodactyl mammal with lime green racing stripes. Here is some blank space for you to spend not thinking about that. See? Before, it was easy not to think of one. But once you read those words, green-striped hippo, there you go. The more you try not to think of one, the more he makes himself at home inside your brain. Artiodactyl: hoofed mammals with an even number of toes. Animals like cows, deer, sheep, camels, goats, and hippopotamuses. (Even green-striped hippos!)</p><h2>Worship and Theology in England, Book 2: From Watts and Wesley to Martineau, 1690-1900</h2><p>This is Book II in Davies&#39; classic three-volume work on the history of the worship and theology of England.

Richardson&#39;s Diaries and Letters, 1917-1919</h2><p>First Lieutenant Roland W. Richardson, pursuit pilot of the 213th Squadron of the American Air Service, often reflected the thoughts and feelings of the thousands of American youths sent to France. In his letters and diaries. What he wrote was not the dramatic fare one may read in aviators' reminiscences and biographies appearing during and just after World War I, but it constitutes a continuing record of the demands of training and combat, of the labor of simply keeping airplanes in the air. His is an intensely personal view of the first American effort to create a flying force for battle.<br>Richardson shows the reader a complete picture of the recruitment, training, staff work, and all the duties a would-be combat pilot had to face helping the novice American Air Service establish itself in war-torn France. He sometimes left out of his letters home the discussions of the dangers he faced from his own equipment and training procedures, but he faithfully included those perils in his diaries. The editors have combined his insights with thorough archival research to provide an unforgettable reading experience. Their combination of the technological, human, military, and social aspects of the American Air Service in France will be consulted for years by all who want to learn more about the origins of the age of aerial warfare.</p><p></p><h2>1812: The March on Moscow</h2><p>&#34;The fruit of more than twenty years of research, this superbly craft work tells the &#39;inside&#39; story of Napoleon&#39;s march to Moscow in a compelingly readable form that rivals the most exciting works of modern fiction&#39;.</p><p></p><h2>The Game [Paperback] [Jan 01, 2013] Neil Strauss</h2><p>The game is an autobiography of the author, neil strauss, and explores his encounters with interesting members of a certain community. It is based on his real-life experiences over a span of two years. The novel talks about a romantically frustrated man who joins a boot camp and becomes a pickup artist. He masters the art of attracting and seducing women so well that soon he turns out to be a guru in the area, outshining the person from whom he learnt the art. The book has surprise elements in the form of the author&#x2019;s encounters with some of the most popular hollywood stars like tom cruise, britney spears, paris hilton, and more. The author transforms himself from a regular guy into a man whom every woman would want to be with. His tone, his conversation skills, and his style is enough to charm any woman. The climax is ironical to the beliefs of the community of pickup artists. The game helps women in understanding the behaviour of such men, and is also suitable for men who want to c</p><p></p><h2>Where&#39;s My Baby?</h2><p>In Where&#39;s My Baby? short verses describe various animal mothers, and pages fold out to reveal their babies; and in the newly rediscovered</p><p>Hans Augusto Rey was born in Hamburg, Germany in 1898. As a child, he spent much of his free time in that city&#39;s famous Hagenbeck Zoo drawing animals. After serving in the army during World War I, he studied philology and natural science at the University of Hamburg. He then married Margret Rey and they moved to Montmartre for four years. The manuscript for the first Curious George books was one of the few items the Reys carried with them on their bicycles when they escaped from Paris in 1940. Eventually, they made their way to the United States, and Curious George was published in 1941. Curious George has been published in many languages, including French, German, Japanese, Afrikaans, and Norwegian. Additional Curious George books followed, as well as such other favorites as CECILY G.

Baird Callicott&#x2019;s decade-long effort to articulate, defend, and extend the seminal environmental philosophy of Aldo Leopold. A leading voice in this new field, Callicott sounds the depths of the proverbial iceberg, the tip of which is &#x201c;The Land Ethic.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Land Ethic,&#x201d; Callicott argues, is traceable to the moral psychology of David Hume and Charles Darwin&#x2019;s classical account of the origin and evolution of Hume&#x2019;s moral sentiments. Leopold adds an ecological vision of organic nature to these foundations.<br><br>How can an evolutionary and ecological environmental ethic bridge the gap between is and ought? How may wholes&#x2015;species, ecosystems, and the biosphere itself&#x2015;be the direct objects of moral concern? How may the intrinsic value of nonhuman natural entities and nature as a whole be justified?<br><br>In addition to confronting and resolving these distinctly philosophical queries, Callicott engages in lively debate with proponents of animal liberation and rights&#x2015;finally to achieve an integrated theory of animal welfare and environmental ethics. He critically discusses the land ethic that is alleged to have prevailed among traditional American Indian peoples and points toward a new and equally revolutionary environmental aesthetic.</p><p><p>J. Baird Callicott is Professor of Philosophy and Natural Resources at the University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point. He is editor of Nature in Asian Traditions of Thought: Essays in Environmental Philosophy with Roger T.

Overholt.</p>&#x201c;This book brings together in one volume a series of essays that have been seminal in the development of environmental philosophy. The reader feels the full impact of a persuasive environmental philosophy as it is now operating to form a world view, oriented toward appropriate biological concern and conservation. Callicott is a fine stylist. His essays are not aimed simply at an audience of fellow philosophers, but also at the general literate public.&#x201d; &#x2015; Holmes Rolston III, Colorado State University<br><br>&#x201c;Aldo Leopold&#x2019;s &#x2018;The Land Ethic&#x2019; is the single most important piece of writing on environmental ethics by a nonphilosopher. This book represents the most comprehensive discussion of philosophical aspects of Leopold&#x2019;s land ethic available. More than any other person, Callicott has focused on these issues. But the book also presents a body of work by an important environmental philosopher in his own right.&#x201d;&#x2015; Eugene C.

Born in central Poland in the town of Radom, she found herself trapped in the ghetto at the age of fourteen, a slave laborer in an armaments factory in the summer of 1942, transported to Auschwitz in the summer of 1944, before being marched to a second armaments factory. She faced death many times; indeed she was certain that she would not survive. But she did.<p> Many years later, when she began to share her past with Eve Keller, the two women rediscovered the world of the teenage girl Millie had been during the war. Most important, Millie revealed her most precious private memory: of a man to whom she was married for a few brief months. He was&#x2014;if not the love of her life&#x2014;her first great unconditional passion. He died, leaving Millie with a single photograph taken on their wedding day, and two rings of gold that affirm the presence of a great passion in the bleakest imaginable time.</p></p><p><b>Millie Werber</b> is today the matriarch of a close and loving family. After moving to the United States in 1946, she and her husband Jack raised their two sons in Queens, NY., where together they built a real estate business. They lived happily together until Jack's death in 2006. Millie now lives on Long Island surrounded by her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.<p><b>Eve Keller</b> is a professor and director of graduate studies at Fordham University. She is the author of <i>Generating Bodies and Gendered Selves: The Rhetoric of Reproduction in Early Modern England</i>, and is a past president of the Society for Literature, Science, and the Arts.</p>While she's decades younger than Alice Herz-Sommer, Millie Werber is also an inspiring figure. Two Rings: A Story of Love and War,' which she wrote with Eve Keller (Public Affairs) is a beautifully written memoir of surviving the Holocaust as a teenager. Werber, who now lives on Long Island, reveals the unlikely heroes of her life, and also a powerful and tragic wartime love story that she had kept hidden in the years since.&#x201d;<p></p><br><p><b><i>Anton Newspapers</i></b><br><br> Werber and Keller movingly convey the hopelessness of being a teenager, a widow, and a factory worker at a Nazi-operated facility, with no end to the casual cruelty and violent deaths in sight. In addition, Werber's 1943 marriage, her time at Auschwitz in 1944, and subsequent relocation to Lippstadt, Germany in 1945 are covered in great detail and make for a compelling read.&#x201d;</p><br><b><i>Sydney Morning Herald / The Age</i></b><b> (Australia)</b><br> A heartbreaking tale of lost love These stories are tributes to those they loved and lost, and whom they want not to be forgotten In between all of this are descriptions of the brutality in the camps.

In the first place, his markings form a map of the world. In the second place, his best friend is...a flea. <br> Fletcher and his flea pal, Jasper, have survived a lot together -- life on the streets, incarceration at the pound, even a flea bath. But now Fletcher has a new home with Jill, and things are looking up. Until Jill and her best friend, Gwen, take Fletcher to school for show-and-tell, and the class's pet rabbit disappears. Everyone knows hounds and hares don't mix, and Fletcher is accused of having done the bunny in. Can he, with a little help from Jasper and Jill and Gwen, sniff out the real rabbit-napper before it's back to the pound for Fletcher?</p><p><b>Elizabeth Levy</b>&nbsp;says:<br> <br>Fletcher Rules!<br> <br>There are three things I love -- dogs, mysteries, and salami. I also am fascinated and moved by the ways we love our pets and they love us. I first wrote about Fletcher, a salami-eating basset hound, in the Something Queer Mysteries more than thirty years ago. But those books were Gwen and Jill's mysteries. I always wondered what Fletcher thought about things. I love hearing from kids and visiting schools. Children from all over the world sent me wonderful drawings of Fletcher. I decided it was time for Fletcher to tell his own stories and star in his own series. But writing is mysterious. I never knew that a friendly flea named Jasper would join Fletcher. As I began these books, Jasper just started popping up and chatting. Now, Gwen, Jill, Fletcher, Mordicai, and I have a new friend. He's rather tiny, but he's a lot of fun, and I'm looking forward to more mysteries with Fletcher and Jasper and their humans, Gwen and Jill.When Jill chooses a new dog, little does she know that the basset hound will endear himself for both his storytelling and mystery-solving abilities. And, of course, there's his fun-loving sidekick, Jasper the flea! Jasper faces his first challenge as Jill and her friend, Gwen, concoct a school exhibit that includes a snow globe AND Jasper himself. William Dufris and Christine Marshall are a dynamic twosome. They alternate characters, accentuating the action and pacing while providing distinctive characterization. Fletcher is an exuberant and adoring pet; Gwen, an ever enthusiastic, faithful friend; James and several other 8-year-olds, typically annoying. Listen in to this engaging story.

She eventually identified the voice that she was hearing as none other than Jesus, delivering a message of compassion and forgiveness for the modern world. This book sold millions of copies worldwide and is currently used in thousands of study groups.</p><p>The acim (&#34;A Course in Miracles&#34;) is a unique metaphysical course. I have a few pointers and ideas here to consider. I do not attempt to alter or miscreate the &#34;course&#34; in any way but to offer a spin on it. Know this; the course is not that revolutionary as it borrows most of its concepts and ideas from Hindu and possibly Zoroastrian thought systems. These are the main issues I have with the &#34;course&#34;; The cause of the separation just does not make sense to me as presented by the &#34;course&#34;. The solution is also seemingly single minded, aka &#34;silver bullet&#34; theory that Americans are so fond of. The problem for me is the ever present philosophical issue is whether to accept or reject the &#34;reality&#34; we dream? This is the million dollar question that faces philosophers and thinkers. The intellectual notion is to reject it but there is a big problem lies therein too. So the actual answer to me at least is to accept life and live it knowing that it is a dream. Personally, I do not have a problem of rebirth and live a life of a child or 20-year old unless the circumstances are just too hard. Who knows that ahead of the time? You cannot fight the dream only gradually accept and realize that taking it seriously is unwise. I know many people who ended up cracking up because they &#34;fight&#34; the ego too hard. As for the cause of the separation, I have learned it differently in Yoga and it makes more sense, at least to me. What I have learned as the &#34;first cause&#34; as it was a &#34;desire of expression&#34; that &#34;made&#34; the Universe as is. The problem is mainly the separation but there are other issues too. But even since it is not created but emanated from Infinity. (A perfect god (infinity) cannot &#34;create&#34; the imperfect Universe, hence the emanation.) The &#34;course&#34; also lacks addressing issues of importance; i.e. how do we handle injustice, corruption and political issues in the &#34;dream&#34;? Do we even bother voting? Lot of people might misunderstand the &#34;course&#34; and apply it rather single mindedly, I am afraid. I do believe in forgiveness as the key, but there might be other facets too, like &#34;service&#34;. I do not believe or like any &#34;silver bullet&#34; theory that &#34;western&#34; esoterism is so fond of. These seeming inconsistencies had stemmed the birth of a cottage industry, writing about a book, teaching the course and of course reinterpreting some of the ideas presented in the over 1000 page of material. Gary Renard is one author, teacher whose interpretation attempts to plug these logical potholes. He, however does not go far enough. Gary had a 9-year long interaction with two ascended masters who rephrased and reinterpreted the main ideas of the &#34;course&#34;. My advise is use your intelligence and common sense to understand these important yet unsettling ideas and keep one important fact in mind. The Hindu Vedas had described &#34;acim&#34; long before Jesus ever walked the earth. --Editors&#39; Review (Murine Press)</p><h2>Railway Guns of World War I (New Vanguard)</h2><p><p>World War I was the Golden Age of the railway gun. More railway artillery pieces were used during this war than in any other conflict, even though at the start of the war none of the armies had railway guns and the very idea of railway artillery was comparatively new. The impetus to build and field railway-mounted guns came from the stalemate of trench warfare. The first railway guns--fielded by the French army in early 1915--were simple, improvised designs made by mounting surplus coastal defense, fortress, and naval guns onto existing commercial railway carriages. These first guns were fielded to primarily provide heavy artillery support to the frontline infantry. The British and German Armies followed suit and soon railway guns were employed all along the Western Front. The use of railway artillery expanded to other fronts too, with Russia fielding several guns in 1915 and Italy in 1916.</p><p>Even the United States--which developed its artillery in close cooperation with the French--employed several models of railway guns in the final year of the war. All told, hundreds of railway artillery pieces were fielded during the war and, at war's end, several models of super-heavy railway guns were in design for use in 1919. </p><p>This book details the design and development of railway guns during World War I from the very first basic designs to massive purpose-built "monster" railway guns. Accompanying the text are many rare, never before published photographs. Color illustrations depict the most important aspects of the railway guns.</p></p><p><p><b>Marc Romanych</b> is a retired US Army combat arms officer, and the author of several books for Osprey on World War I artillery and fortifications.

The information is relatively timeless and still relevant to the never-ending quest for better analysis. The articles are based on reviewing cognitive psychology literature concerning how people process information to make judgments on incomplete and ambiguous information. Richard Heur has selected the experiments and findings that seem most relevant to intelligence analysis and most in need of communication to intelligence analysts. He then translates the technical reports into language that intelligence analysts can understand and interpreted the relevance of these findings to the problems intelligence analysts face.</p><p>Richards J. Heuer, Jr., worked for the CIA for nearly 45 years-first as a staff officer from 1951 until his retirement in 1979, and then as a contractor on a variety of projects until 1995. He began his career in the Directorate of Operations and later transferred to the Directorate of Intelligence, where he headed the unit working on analytic methods in the Office of Political Analysis. He went on to work as a consultant for the Department of Defense Personnel Security Research Center in Monterey, California. Mr. Heuer was awarded the Agency Seal Medallion in 1987 for developing and teaching an innovative methodology for addressing complex and challenging problems facing the intelligence community. He was recognized in 1988 for his &#34;outstanding contribution to the literature of intelligence,&#34; and again in 1996 for &#34;superior accomplishment.&#34; In addition to his work on the psychology of intelligence analysis, Mr. Heuer is a published author on counterintelligence, deception, analytical methodology, and personnel security issues.</p><h2>The Corridors of Time</h2><p>light wear light toning to pages 12mo - over 6�&#34; - 7�&#34; tall.

In this authoritative, exuberant cookbook, renowned culinary expert Diane Kochilas shares recipes for cold and warm mezes, salads, pastas and grains, stews and one-pot dishes, baked vegetable and bean specialties, stuffed vegetables, soups, savory pies and basic breads, and dishes that feature eggs. Brimming with classic dishes, regional favorites, and inspired innovations, <i>The Greek Vegetarian </i>pays tribute to one of the world's most venerable and healthful cuisines.<br><br></p><p>In Ithaca, the villagers so revere the olive that they give names to the olive trees that bear them. We're not talking upstate New York here, but Greece, the land that gave us rosy-fingered dawns and spanakopita. Diane Kochilas gives us the Greek way with vegetables in <i>The Greek Vegetarian</i>, and she should be given some kind of humanitarian award for the effort. For anyone fussing over increasing greens, vegetables, and grains while reducing the place of meat in the usual American diet, <i>The Greek Vegetarian</i> is a place of comfort and repose, a place to settle back in the sun and flip through the pages and let the deliciousness of all these wonderful food ideas lap over your life like warm waves from the Aegean Sea. <p> There are 100 recipes herein, and they come from the traditions of Greek cuisine. No one is stretching just to make a dish vegetarian (oh, OK: there's one recipe for vegetarian souvlaki). Only recently have Greeks gained the dubious title of biggest meat eaters in Europe, and even then all they did, according to the author, was make their plates bigger for the added meat. They still eat a diet rich in vegetables. Always have; always will.</p><p> But some specifics. Kochilas divides her book into Meze, the little dishes of Greece, and Main Meals, the pastas, soups, stews, casseroles, savory pies and breads, the egg dishes. There's Beet and Apple Salad with a Yogurt Dressing, for starters. How about Roasted Eggplant and Chickpea Salad? Or Arugula Salad with Wrinkled Olives and Orange Slices? The Classic Greek Bean Soup is included. So too is a dish of Potatoes Stewed with Kalamata Olives. The possibilities build, one upon the other. This book bursts with flavor the same way a vine-ripened, sun-warmed tomato bursts at the first bite. It will dribble down your chin if you're not careful. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>"Delicious and lively...Here is the rare cookbook I'd like to cook my way through, front to back." --Michelle Huneven, <i>Los Angeles Times</i><p> "This is the loveliest cookbook imaginable, full of splendid recipes and lore, and moreover just shining with Diane Kochilas's intelligent passion for the cuisines of Greece." --Nancy Harmon Jenkins, author of <i>The Mediterranean Diet Cookbook</i></p><p> "<i>The Greek Vegetarian</i> is an important book, because it brings together a broad spectrum of vibrant, healthy, delicious dishes.

DeMille</h2><p>BEST KNOWN AS THE DIRECTOR of such spectacular films as <i>The Ten Commandments </i>and <i>King of Kings, </i>Cecil B. DeMille lived a life as epic as any of his cinematic masterpieces. <br><br>As a child DeMille learned the Bible from his father, a theology student and playwright who introduced Cecil and his older brother, William, to the theater. Tutored by impresario David Belasco, DeMille discovered how audiences responded to showmanship: sets, lights, costumes, etc. He took this knowledge with him to Los Angeles in 1913, where he became one of the movie pioneers, in partnership with Jesse Lasky and Lasky&#x2019;s brother-in-law Samuel Goldfish (later Goldwyn). Working out of a barn on streets fragrant with orange blossom and pepper trees, the Lasky company turned out a string of successful silents, most of them directed by DeMille, who became one of the biggest names of the silent era. With films such as <i>The Squaw Man, Brewster&#x2019;s Millions, Joan the Woman, </i>and <i>Don&#x2019;t Change Your Husband, </i>he was the creative backbone of what would become Paramount Studios. In 1923 he filmed his first version of <i>The Ten Commandments </i>and later a second biblical epic, <i>King of Kings, </i>both enormous box-office successes<i>. <br></i><br>Although his reputation rests largely on the biblical epics he made, DeMille&#x2019;s personal life was no morality tale. He remained married to his wife, Constance, for more than fifty years, but for most of the marriage he had three mistresses simultaneously, all of whom worked for him. He showed great loyalty to a small group of actors who knew his style, but he also discovered some major stars, among them Gloria Swanson, Claudette Colbert, and later, Charlton Heston. <br><br>DeMille was one of the few silent-era directors who made a completely successful transition to sound. In 1952 he won the Academy Award for Best Picture with <i>The Greatest Show on Earth</i>. When he remade <i>The Ten Commandments </i>in 1956<i>, </i>it was an even bigger hit than the silent version. He could act, too: in Billy Wilder&#x2019;s classic film <i>Sunset Boulevard, </i>DeMille memorably played himself<i>. <br></i><br>In the 1930s and 1940s DeMille became a household name thanks to the <i>Lux Radio Theater, </i>which he hosted. But after falling out with a union, he gave up the program, and his politics shifted to the right as he championed loyalty oaths and Sen. Joseph McCarthy&#x2019;s anticommunist witch hunts. <br><br>As Scott Eyman brilliantly demonstrates in this superbly researched biography, which draws on a massive cache of DeMille family papers not available to previous biographers, DeMille was much more than his clich�d image. A gifted director who worked in many genres; a devoted family man and loyal friend with a highly unconventional personal life; a pioneering filmmaker: DeMille comes alive in these pages, a legend whose spectacular career defined an era.</p><p>Scott Eyman has written fifteen books, three of them <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including <i>John Wayne: The Life and Legend</i>. His most recent book is <i>Hank and Jim</i>. He has been awarded the William K. Everson Award for Film History by the National Board of Review. He teaches film history at the University of Miami and lives in West Palm Beach with his wife, Lynn.*Starred Review* DeMille wasn&#x2019;t the sole originator of the huger-than-huge Hollywood movie, but he was one of its most successful purveyors. And unlike some silent-film auteurs, DeMille made the change to talkies seamlessly in a career that spanned more than 50 years of stage and screen hits across genres. Aided by access to DeMille family papers unavailable to previous biographers, Eyman, a seasoned biographer of Hollywood heavyweights, undertakes an exhaustive and evenhanded look at DeMille and his oeuvre. Whereas Sidney Lumet thought &#x201c;DeMille vulgarized everything D. W. Griffith did,&#x201d; Eyman finds that &#x201c;DeMille was always a populist filmmaker, like Frank Capra,&#x201d; albeit one who &#x201c;took serious . . . successful flyers at Art.&#x201d; And such flyers he took: his The Ten Commandments (1923 and 1956) and The King of Kings (1927) are gaudy touchstones of epic filmmaking grandeur and glorifications of conventional Christian values, but he also directed The Volga Boatman (1928), &#x201c;a surprisingly sympathetic account of the Russian Revolution.&#x201d; In his career, DeMille directed a veritable who&#x2019;s who of Hollywood stars and also found time to appear in films as an actor, his best-known role perhaps being as himself in Billy Wilder&#x2019;s 1950 masterpiece, Sunset Boulevard. Eyman&#x2019;s sprawling biography fully gives the master his due. --Mike Tribby</p><h2>The Christmas Story</h2><p>The timeless story of Christmas is beautifully retold through paintings by some of the world&#x2019;s greatest artists.

It is a Lost Prince story that avoids both black-and-white morality and the standard fantasy-novel adoration of royalty. Furthermore, it is inspired by the unlikeliest of sources, the Rat King legend and the Pied Piper of Hamelin fairy tale. Finally, <i>King Rat</i>, powered and propelled by the rhythms of jungle/drum-'n'-bass music, is a fantasy novel set in the 1990s that genuinely captures the 1990s. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>"This is a riveting, brilliant novel. The language sings, the concepts are original and engrossing." --Charles de Lint<p> "A genuine contribution to London's subterranean mythology. <i>King Rat</i> is as sharp as a Tokyo comic. It's humane and delinquent. And it bites." --Iain Sinclair</p><p> "[Mieville's] prose melds James Herbert's nihilistic violence with the metropolitan paranoia of Martin Amis, circa London Fields, and he shows a talent for authentic dialog and cinematic set pieces. Most striking, perhaps, is the meticulously crafted topography of a brooding London peopled by despondent youth and bizarre night creatures and rife with the rhythms of drum 'n' bass." --<i>The Times</i> (London)</p><p> "<i>King Rat</i>: a story so compelling you almost haven't time to notice how fine the writing is; a dark myth reinvented for our time and for London in particular with great wit, style, and imagination." --Ramsey Campbell</p><p> "[An] extraordinary debut novel. . . . China Mieville is a remarkably eloquent new writer who has produced genuine magic here." --<i>Locus</i></p><p> "<i>King Rat</i> goes down as sweetly as week-old garbage, to leave the reader eyeing speculatively the manhole covers of Soho and Battersea. A knotted, toothy, thought-provoking read." --M. John Harrison</p></p><h2>Brightly Woven</h2><p>When Wayland North brings rain to a region that's been dry for over ten years, he's promised anything he'd like as a reward. He chooses the village elder's daughter, sixteen-year-old Sydelle Mirabel, who is a skilled weaver and has an unusual knack for repairing his magical cloaks. Though Sydelle has dreamt of escaping her home, she's hurt that her parents relinquish her so freely and finds herself awed and afraid of the slightly ragtag wizard who is unlike any of the men of magic in the tales she's heard. Still, she is drawn to this mysterious man who is fiercely protective of her and so reluctant to share his own past. <br><br>The pair rushes toward the capital, intent to stop an imminent war, pursued by Reuel Dorwan (a dark wizard who has taken a keen interest in Sydelle) and plagued by unusually wild weather. But the sudden earthquakes and freak snowstorms may not be a coincidence. As Sydelle discovers North's dark secret and the reason for his interest in her and learns to master her own mysterious power, it becomes increasingly clear that the fate of the kingdom rests in her fingertips. She will either be a savior, weaving together the frayed bonds between Saldorra and Auster, or the disastrous force that destroys both kingdoms forever.</p><p>Alexandra Bracken has wanted to be a writer since third grade, and has always wanted to write for children and young adults. She began Brightly Woven as a birthday present for a friend, and the novel grew over a year of wild weather.

As payment he asks for Sydelle, the daughter of the village elder. Despite her protests, he whisks her away just as an invading army arrives in the village. The wizard, Wayland, has information that may prevent the coming war. But he and "his assistant" must make a harrowing, weeks-long journey to reach the capital and deliver the information. Along the way, Sydelle must overcome her anger toward Wayland, discover the dark secret that haunts him, and unravel the mystery of why he chose her in the first place. Sydelle is a strong, brave, likable heroine. Hers is a story of a young woman finding the great power within herself. Wayland is a tortured soul who saves and is saved by her. The supporting characters add color and depth to the story. Danger appears at every turn, and action keeps the plot moving briskly along.

Yet magic of the fabled weapon makes it as dangerous to Shea as it is to the Warlock Lord.

"How could I have been such a fool? I should have seen it right away!"<br><br>Shea walked silently to the north end of the clearing, his eyes staring at the faint trail in the forest earth that the crafty Orl Fane had left in his flight northward. He had been so close. He had held the precious Sword in his own hands--only to lose it through an unforgivable failure to recognize the truth. The massive form of Keltset loomed silently beside him, the great bulk bending close to the damp, leaf-strewn ground, the inscrutable face almost next to his own as the strangely gentle eyes studied and searched. Shea turned quietly back to the raging Panamon.<br><br>"It wasn't your fault--you had no reason to suspect the truth," he muttered dejectedly. "I should have listened to his raving with a little more wisdom and a little less . . . whatever. I knew the signs to look for and I forgot to keep my eyes open when it counted."<br><br>Panamon nodded and shrugged, stroking the carefully trimmed mustache with the point of his piked hand. With a last kick at the discarded implements, he called once to Keltset, and without further discussion the two began quickly to break camp, strapping together the gear and weapons that had been deposited for the night. Shea watched them for a moment, still unable to accept his failure to gain possession of the Sword. Panamon called gruffly to him to lend a hand, and he silently obeyed. He could not face the inevitable aftermath of this most recent setback. Panamon Creel had obviously been pushed as far as he would stand it, chaperoning a foolish and amazingly stupid little Valeman around in the dangerous borderlands of Paranor, searching for some people who might very well turn out to be enemies and for a Sword that only Shea knew anything about, but couldn't recognize when he had it in his own hands. The scarlet highwayman and his giant companion had nearly lost their lives once already over this mysterious Sword and undoubtedly once was more than enough. The Valeman had no choice now except to try to locate his friends. But when he did find them, he would have to confront Allanon and tell him how he had failed--failed them all. He shuddered at the prospect of facing the grim Druid, of feeling those remorseless eyes peer into his most carefully hidden thoughts for the whole truth. It was not going to be pleasant.<br><br>He recalled suddenly the strange prophecy related to them in the Valley of Shale on that dark, misted dawn over a week ago. It was the Shade of Bremen who had forewarned of the danger in the forbidding Dragon's Teeth--how one would not see Paranor, how one would not reach the other side of the mountain, yet would be first to lay hands on the Sword of Shannara. It had all been foretold, but Shea had forgotten it in the stress and excitement of the past few days.<br><br>The weary Valeman closed his eyes against the world for a few moments and wondered how on earth he could possibly be a part of this incredible puzzle that centered around a war of power with the spirit world and a legendary Sword. He felt so small and helpless that it seemed that the easiest path for him to choose now was to bury himself and pray for a quick end to life. So much depended on him, if Allanon were to be believed, and from the beginning he had been completely inadequate to the task. He had been unable to do anything for himself, depending on the strength of other men to get him this far. How much had they all sacrificed for him so that he might lay hands on the magic Sword. Yet when he had it in his grasp . . .<br><br>"I've decided. We're going after him."<br><br>Panamon Creel's deep voice cut through the quiet of the little clearing like the sharp crack of an iron blade through dry wood. Shea stared at the broad, unsmiling face in astonishment.<br><br>"You mean . . . into the Northland?"<br><br>The scarlet thief shot him one of those angry looks that dismissed the Valeman as an idiot incapable of understanding sane men.<br><br>"He made a fool out of me. I'd rather cut my own throat than let the little rat get away from me now. When I get my hands on him this time, I'll leave him for the worms to chew on."<br><br>The handsome face was emotionless, but there was undisguisable hatred in the menacing tone of voice that cut through to the bone. This was the other side of Panamon--the cold professional who had ruthlessly destroyed an entire encampment of Gnomes and later stood in battle against the incomparable power of the Skull Bearer. He wasn't doing this for Shea or even to gain possession of the Sword of Shannara. This was strictly a matter of his injured pride and desire for revenge on the unfortunate creature who had dared to bruise it. Shea glanced quickly at the motionless Keltset, but the giant Rock Troll gave no indication of either approval or disapproval; the barklike face was blank, the deep-set eyes expressionless. Panamon laughed sharply, taking a few quick strides toward the hesitant Valeman.<br><br>"Think on this, Shea. Our Gnome friend has made matters so much more simple by revealing the exact location of the Sword you have been searching so long to find. Now you don't have to search for it--we know where it is."<br><br>Shea nodded in silent agreement, still wary of the adventurer's true motives. "Do we have a chance of catching up with him?"<br><br>"That's more like it--that's the spirit we need." Panamon grinned at him, his face a mask of confidence. "Of course we can catch up with him--it's merely a matter of time. The difficulty will be if someone else catches up with him first. Keltset knows the Northland as well as anyone alive. The Gnome will not be able to hide from us. He will have to run, run, and keep running, because he has no one to turn to, not even his own people. It's impossible to know exactly how he stumbled onto the Sword, or even how he surmised its value, but I do know I was not mistaken about his being a deserter and a scavenger."<br><br>"He could have been a member of the band of Gnomes transporting the Sword to the Warlock Lord--or perhaps even a prisoner?" Shea suggested thoughtfully.<br><br>"More probably the latter," the other agreed, hesitating as if trying to recall something, staring northward into the gray mistiness of the forest morning. The sun had already cleared the horizon of the eastern edge of the world, its fresh light bright and warm, seeping slowly into the darkened corners of the forestland. But the mist of early morning had not yet cleared, leaving the three companions shrouded in a hazy mixture of sunlight and dying night. The sky to the north appeared unaccountably dark and forbidding even for early morning, causing the normally verbose Panamon to stare wordlessly at this curious blackness for several long minutes. Finally he turned back to them, his face clouded with doubt.<br><br>"Something strange is going on to the north. Keltset, let's move out now--find that Gnome before he has a chance to stumble onto a patrol of hunters. I don't want to share his final moments in this world with anyone!"<br><br>The giant Rock Troll moved into the lead in quick, easy strides, his head lowered slightly as he searched the ground before him, picking out the signs left by the fleeing Orl Fane. Panamon and Shea followed close behind in silent concentration. The trail of their quarry was readily apparent to the keen eyes of Keltset. He turned back to them and made a short signal with one hand, which Panamon translated for the curious Shea to mean that the Gnome was running hard and fast, not bothering to hide his footsteps, and had evidently decided on his eventual destination.<br><br>Shea began to speculate in his own mind where the wily little fellow would run. With the Sword in his possession, he might be able to redeem himself in the eyes of his own people by turning it over to them for presentation to the Warlock Lord. But Orl Fane had appeared highly irrational in his behavior while he was their prisoner, and Shea felt certain that the Gnome had not been faking. He had rambled on as if the victim of a madness he could only partially control, speaking in garbled sentences that had in a jumbled fashion revealed the truth concerning the whereabouts of the Sword. If Shea had thought the matter through a little more carefully, he would have seen it--he would have known that Orl Fane had the coveted talisman with him. No, the Gnome had crossed the mental barrier between sanity and madness, and his actions would not be entirely predictable. He would run from them, but to whom would he run?<br><br>"I remember now." Panamon broke into his thoughts as they continued to make their way back toward the Plains of Streleheim. "That winged creature insisted that we had possession of the Sword when it confronted us yesterday. It kept telling us that it could sense the presence of the Sword--and so it could, because Orl Fane was concealed in the brush with the weapon hidden in his sack."<br><br>Shea nodded quietly, recalling the incident bitterly. The Skull Bearer had unwittingly tipped them off that the precious Sword was in the area, but they had failed to notice this important clue in the heat and fury of their battle to survive. Panamon continued to ramble on in barely concealed fury, threatening to dispose of Orl Fane when they caught up with him in a number of extremely unpleasant ways. Then abruptly the fringes of the forest broke away, opening into the vast expanse of the Plains of Streleheim.<br><br>In astonishment, the three halted together, their disbelieving eyes fixed on the awesome spectacle that loomed directly to the north--a huge, unbroken wall of blackness, towering skyward until it vanished into the infinity of space, stretching along the horizon to encircle the entire Northland. It was as if the Skull King had bound the ancient land in the shroud of darkness that lay upon the spirit world. It was more than the blackness of a clouded night. It was a heavy mistiness that rolled and swirled in deepening shades of gray as it ran northward toward the heart of the Skull Kingdom. It was the most terrifying sight that Shea had ever witnessed. His initial fear was heightened twice over by a sudden, unexplainable certainty in his mind that this huge wall was crawling slowly southward, blanketing the entire world. It meant that the Warlock Lord was coming. . . .<br><br>"What in heaven's name is that . . . ?" Panamon trailed off into stunned silence.<br><br>Shea shook his head absently. There could be no answer to that question. This was something beyond the understanding of mortal man. The three stood looking at the massive wall for several long moments, as if waiting for something more to happen. Finally, Keltset stooped to peer carefully at the hard grassland before them, moving forward several yards at a time until he was some distance away. Then he rose and pointed directly into the center of the ominous black haze. Panamon started, his face frozen.<br><br>"The Gnome is running directly into that stuff," he muttered angrily. "If we do not catch him before he reaches it, the darkness will hide his trail completely. We will have lost him."<br><br>Several miles ahead, on the graying fringes of the blackened wall of mist and haze, the small, bent form of Orl Fane hesitated momentarily in its exhausting flight as the greenish eyes peered fearfully, uncomprehendingly into the swirling darkness. The Gnome had been moving northward since his escape from the three strangers during the early hours of the morning, running while his strength held out, then pushing forward in a shuffling trot, always with one eye straying back, waiting for the inevitable pursuit. His mind no longer functioned in a rational manner; for several weeks he had lived on instinct and luck, preying off the dead, avoiding the living. He could not force himself to think of anything beyond survival, a gut instinct to live another day among those who did not want him, would not accept him as one of their own. Even his own people had turned him away, scorning him as a creature lower than the insects that crawled the earth at their feet. It was a savage land that surrounded him--a land in which one could not survive alone for very long. Yet he was alone, and the mind that had once been sane had slowly turned inward on itself, shutting away the fears that were imbedded there until madness began to take hold and all reason began to die.<br><br>Yet the inevitable death did not come easily, as fate intervened with twisted humor and favored the outcast with a final glimmer of false hope, placing in his hands the means by which to regain the seemingly unattainable warmth of human companionship once more. While still a scavenger, still fighting a losing battle to stay alive, the desperate Gnome had learned of the presence of the legendary Sword of Shannara, its awesome secret gasped in faint warning from the rigid lips of one dying on the Streleheim Plains, the blinded eyes failing as the life thread snapped. Then the Sword was in his grasp--the key to power over mortal men in the hands of Orl Fane.<br><br>But the madness lingered, the fears and doubts wrenching ceaselessly at his failing reason as he pondered a course of action. This fatal hesitation resulted in the Gnome's capture and the loss of the coveted Sword--the lifeline back to his own kind. Reason gave way to despair and raving, and the already badly unbalanced mind collapsed. There was room now for only one burning, haunting thought--the Sword must be his or his life was over. He boasted irrationally to his unsuspecting captors that the Sword was his, that only he knew where it could be found, unwittingly betraying his last chance to keep possession. But the strangers failed to read between the lines, dismissing him too hastily as merely crazed. Then came the escape, the seizure of the Sword, and the flight northward.<br><br>He paused now, staring blankly at the mysterious wall of blackness that barred his way northward. Yes, northward, northward, he mused, smiling crookedly, the eyes widening madly. There lay safety and redemption for an outcast. Deep within, he could feel an almost uncanny desire to run back the way he had come. But the thought remained locked inescapably in his mind that his salvation lay in the Northland alone. It was there that he would find . . . the Master. The Warlock Lord. His gaze dropped momentarily to the ancient blade strapped tightly to his waist, its length dragging clumsily in the dirt behind him. The gnarled yellow hands strayed briefly down over the carved handle, touching the engraved hand raised high with burning torch, the gilt paint already flecking off in chips to reveal the burnished hilt beneath. He clutched the handle tightly, as if trying to draw his own strength from its sturdy grip. Fools! Fools all, that had not treated him with the respect he should command. For he was the bearer of the Sword, the keeper of the greatest leg-end their world had ever known, and it would be he who would . . . He shut out the thought hastily, fearful that even the void about him could read his mind, peer into his secret thoughts, and steal them away.</p><h2>The Norman Conquest</h2><p>An epic tale, with violence at its heart, and a triumph of narrative history.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><b>The Norman Conquest</b><i> </i>starts with the most decisive battle in English history and continues with dramatic rebellions and their ruthless suppression, eventually resulting in the creation of the English nation. The repercussions of the Conquest are with us still.<br>&nbsp;<br>The book begins with the Saxon kings, specifically Edward the Confessor, and shows how England was in constant conflict as the English fell prey to both Vikings and Normans. In the north, King Harold destroys his Viking namesake at the battle of Stamford Bridge but immediately has to hurry south to confront William of Normandy at Hastings. His defeat, and the destruction of the Anglo-Saxon warrior caste, leads inexorably to William's forceful occupation of an unwilling country, and this is the ruthless story Marc Morris tells. It is a drama crammed with intrigue, bloodshed and betrayal, featuring vivid, almost deranged characters: Edward the Confessor, who spurns his queen in their marriage bed to spite her family, even though it spells the end of his own dynasty; the heroic King Harold, the hero of Stamford Bridge and the last Saxon king, who perjures himself, betrays his brother and puts aside his wife in his bid for the throne; William the Bastard, later known as the Conqueror, who assembles the mightiest invasion fleet in the middle ages and after unexpected success almost destroys the country he has won.</p><p>MARC MORRIS is an historian and broadcaster. He studied and taught history at the universities of London and Oxford, and his doctorate on the thirteenth-century earls of Norfolk was published in 2005. In 2003 he presented the highly-acclaimed television series <i>Castle</i>, and wrote its accompanying book. His most recent book, <b>A Great and Terrible King</b>, was published by Hutchinson in 2008.&#34;Almost everything you know about 1066 is wrong. And there&#39;s no better historian to put you right than the wonderful Marc Morris. His new book grips not only as a work of narrative history but also as a sleuthing exercise ... Morris has captured the triumph and the tragedy of this tumultuous era with verve, insight and a rollicking narrative.&#34; Mail on Sunday &#34;Morris gives a compelling account of the invasion by William the Conqueror in 1066 ... Confidently, he opens with the Bayeux Tapestry as a powerful contemporary depiction of a famous battle ... Morris sorts embroidery from evidence and provides a much-needed, modern account of the Normans in England that respects past events more than present ideologies.&#34; -- Iain Finlayson The Times &#34;Marc Morris&#39;s lively new book retells the story of the Norman invasion with vim, vigour and narrative urgency&#34; Evening Standard &#34;As every schoolboy knows, or used to, 1066 is the most important date in English history. But as Marc Morris points out in this enormously enjoyable book, the Norman conquest was much more violent, complicated and ambiguous then we usually think. Carefully steering the reader through the partisan and often contradictory sources, he paints a vivid picture of the collapse of the sophisticated Anglo-Saxon realm, and shows how William the Conqueror relied on sheer terror to establish his reign. Even a Norman chronicler admitted that William had &#34;mercilessly slaughtered&#34; the English, &#34;like the scourge of God smiting them for their sins.&#34; -- Dominic Sandbrook The Sunday Times, Books of the Year &#34;I loved it - a suitably epic account of one of the most seismic and far-reaching events in British history.&#34; -- Dan Snow</p><h2>First and Only: A psychological thriller</h2><p>WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT FIRST AND ONLY I wasn't sure what to expect from the cover or the blurb but I couldn't put it down until I finished it --- LB A truly fantastic book, you simply won&#x2019;t want, nor be able to put it down until you have the answers --- Linda I found myself leaning further towards my laptop screen the further into the book I got --- Janieritson I didn't want to put it down, but at the same time, I really didn't want it to end --- Manchester Anne DESCRIPTION Do you believe in psychics?

Edith Nesbit (1858&#x2013;1924) was an English author and poet; she published her books for children under the name of E. Nesbit. She wrote or collaborated on more than 60 books of fiction for children. She was also a political activist and co-founded the Fabian Society, a socialist organisation later affiliated to the Labour Party.</p><p>English author Edith Nesbit s impressive body of work includes poems, plays, novels, and even ghost stories, however, she is best known for her beloved children s adventure stories, published under the name E. Nesbit. Among Nesbit s best-known works are The Story of the Treasure-Seekers, The Railway Children, The Wouldbegoods and Five Children and It. Nesbit s novels departed from the children s literary tradition of fantasy-worlds popularized by Lewis Carroll and Kenneth Grahame, and instead focused on the adventures to be had from real-life experiences. Nesbit s work inspired other writers like C. S. Lewis, P. L Travers, and J. K. Rowling, and many of her stories have been adapted for film and television. In addition to writing, Nesbit was an activist and co-founded the Fabian Society, a socialist group that provided the foundation for the modern British Labour Party. Nesbit died in 1924.</p><h2>Corduroy</h2><p>These volumes comprise Bell's celebrated trilogy of novelized memoirs set in the West Suffolk countryside between the two World Wars.

His father, news editor of the Observer, was a republican and a socialist and had no truck with university education. His son was to do something useful; in 1920 he went to East Anglia to work as a farm apprentice. He subsequently became a farmer himself. These experiences provide the material for his famous rural trilogy, Corduroy, Silver Ley and The Cherry Tree. In total he wrote over twenty-five books, he also set the first Times in 1930 and continued to devise crosswords for the paper for the next thirty years.</p><h2>Lenin&#39;s Legacy: A Concise History and Guide to Soviet Collectibles (Schiffer Military History)</h2><p>Lenin&#39;s Legacy is a comprehensive, illustrated reference combining a concise history of the Soviet Union with a study of its &#34;symbolism&#34;, which until now has largely been hidden from the West.

In this wonderfully personal guide to Ireland, Makem provides a unique itinerary characterized by his rich knowledge of Ireland's cities, charming small towns, and out-of-the-way villages. Numerous ancient sites are pointed out in detail, with Makem providing colorful vignettes and mythic renderings of life as it might have been in centuries past. Just as the country is brimming with fascinating historical settings and points of interest with wide appeal, Makem highlights sparkling gems wherever he finds them--in natural landscapes, architectural wonders, and Ireland's warmly welcoming populace. Makem's guide will allow all visitors who explore the Emerald Isle to share in a bountiful treasure trove of experiences and sights. <i>Alice Joyce</i>Makem, the popular banjo player and Irish folk singer, takes readers on a "personal tour" of his homeland. Each chapter focuses on a particular region of Ireland, including pictures and descriptions of the monuments and cities mentioned, as well as the author's personal memories and the lyrics of the related Irish folk songs. While the text includes a comprehensive assortment of facts, legends, and historical information, the writing is disjointed and simplistic. Had Makem teamed up with a good writer, his book could have been a treasure. Unfortunately, the poor writing overpowers all else, and this book is not recommended.?Kathleen A.

If we were to eliminate not only the name &#34;Method&#34; but also its common conception, this would become much clearer. We must consider the human personality and not a method of education. For the word &#34;Method&#34; we should substitute something like this: &#34;Help given in order that the human personality may achieve its independence&#34; or &#34;means offered to deliver the personality from the oppression of age-old prejudices regarding education.&#34; Vol. 3, The Clio Montessori Series, Montessori-Pierson Publishing Company In this book, Dr. Montessori urges adults towards an understanding of the laws of growth, and pleads for a reshaping of the educational system that is ironically prejudiced against the child. First printed in 1955, the book includes a chapter on world illiteracy, as it is a problem of grave magnitude, even today.</p><p></p><h2>Best Words, Best Order: Essays on Poetry</h2><p>In Best Words, Best Order Stephen Dobyns explains the mystery of the poet&#39;s work and the ability of poetry to communicate thought and feeling between the mind of the writer and the mind of the reader.</p><p>As its title implies, Stephen Dobyns&#39;s rigorous collection of essays about poetry celebrates Coleridge&#39;s dictum that poetry is the best words in the best order. Dobyns&#39;s probing examinations of the elements of poetry--metaphor, pacing, tone--and his study of the evolution of free verse are not for Sunday-sunset versifiers. They are strenuous, meaty, and wholly satisfying fare, intended for serious students of poetry. Dobyns, the author of eight volumes of poetry (and 17 novels), believes, like Baudelaire, that &#34;each poem ... has an optimum number of words [and] an optimum number of pieces of information ... and to go over or under even by one word weakens the whole.&#34; Poetry, he says, belongs to the reader, not the writer, and as readers, &#34;at the close of the poem, we must not only feel that our expectations have been met but that our lives have been increased, if only to a small degree.&#34; And, if that&#39;s not challenge enough for the writer, add to it &#34;that the conclusion of a given piece must appear both inevitable and surprising.&#34; The final third of the book comprises chapters on four writers, each of whom represents to Dobyns an ideal in poetry: Rainer Maria Rilke, who Dobyns says worked harder than any other poet to develop and change his work; Osip Mandelstam, an exemplar of moral centeredness; Anton Chekhov, for his sense of personal freedom; and Yannis Ritsos, for his &#34;sense of the mystery that surrounds us.&#34;Stephen Dobyns teaches in the MFA program at Warren Wilson College.</p><h2>The Wild Ones</h2><p><p><b>For fans of Warriors, Spirit Animals, and Redwall--the next great animal fantasy adventure is here!</b><br><br> Kit is a young raccoon who has lived his whole life under the Big Sky.

It was known far and wide as a den of thieves and crooks and cheats. In Ankle Snap Alley, honest folk were rare as roses in winter, and a decent house pet from a good home would never set foot in such a garbage heap.<br><br>And yet, one night, not all that long ago, a whisper-thin silver dog came creeping into the winding paths of the alley. The dog was a miniature greyhound. He stepped daintily across the broken concrete, hopped over weedchoked trash, and skirted the rusted skeleton of a bicycle, which he glanced at with disgust.<br><br>The dog&#x2019;s collar was fine leather, and two jingling tags hung off it. One tag said he&#x2019;d had all his shots from the veterinarian, and the other gave the address of the home where his People fed him and bathed him and invited him to sleep at the foot of their soft feather bed.&nbsp;<br>The dog froze in place, lifted one paw from the earth, and sniffed at the moon-kissed air. He swiveled his thin neck around and saw a glint of yellow eyes in the shadow between two buildings. A tiny bell made a delicate tinkling noise. The jingle of the dog&#x2019;s tags answered the bell. That was the signal. The dog was in the right place.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have information for me?&#x201d; he asked the shadowy figure. Although the miniature greyhound&#x2019;s body was dainty, his voice was deep and rumbling, like dynamite in a silk purse.&nbsp;<br><br>Two yellow eyes blazed from the shadows. &#x201c;Me?&#x201d; the other creature replied. &#x201c;No, I do not.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>The dog snarled. &#x201c;How dare you call me out here at this undogly hour and waste my time with no information.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Listen more carefully, Titus,&#x201d; hissed the creature in the shadows. &#x201c;I said I don&#x2019;t have information for you. But he does.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>There was a flash of orange claw as the figure shoved a small animal from the shadows into a puddle of moonlight. It was a black-and-white woodpecker with a shock of red plumage atop its head. It looked about frantically. The little bird&#x2019;s wings were bound to its body by a rubber band, and a metal paper clip clamped its beak shut. One of the bird&#x2019;s eyes was swollen shut, and it hopped forward with a distinct limp.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;He took some convincing,&#x201d; the shadowy figure said. &#x201c;But I promised if he talked I wouldn&#x2019;t eat his head.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>The bird squealed through his clamped beak.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Now tell him what you told me,&#x201d; the creature ordered the bird. &#x201c;Have they found the Bone of Contention?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>The bird shook his head no. The dog exhaled with relief.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;But they&#x2019;ve found a clue,&#x201d; said the figure in the shadows. &#x201c;He saw &#x2019;em buy a stone from a traveling deer. It had the markings of Azban, the First Raccoon, on it. Isn&#x2019;t that so?&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The bird nodded yes.&nbsp;<br><br>The dog sighed. &#x201c;So they&#x2019;re closer than ever to finding the Bone?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;If you believe the Bone is real,&#x201d; said the shadowy voice. &#x201c;Cats don&#x2019;t put much faith in the old stories.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You cats were wild in the old days,&#x201d; said Titus. &#x201c;We dogs were not. We know the Bone of Contention is real. And that is why it must never be found.&#x201d; The dog narrowed his eyes at the woodpecker. &#x201c;Tell me, bird, where do they live?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Mrrpm, mrrm, mrrrp,&#x201d; said the bird through his clipped beak.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Hush,&#x201d; said the dog. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk.&#x201d; He slid a piece of tree bark forward on the ground and placed it directly beneath the bird in the white moonlight. &#x201c;Write.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>The bird bent its head and pecked at the bark on the ground; the tap-tap-tap of its beak echoed in the quiet. When it was done, the dog looked at the address the woodpecker had pecked.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; he said. Then he spoke to the yellow-eyed shadow. &#x201c;Sixclaw, you&#x2019;ll take care of them?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>The figure in the shadows laughed. &#x201c;You dogs never say what you mean. &#x2018;Take care of them&#x2019;?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You know what I mean.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You want them dead?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I want them dead,&#x201d; Titus agreed. &#x201c;No one can ever find the Bone of Contention. Especially not the stinking raccoons, not their stinking children, not their children&#x2019;s children . . . who I am certain will also stink.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>The creature stepped from the shadow into the circle of moonlight beside the captive woodpecker. He was an orange-and-white cat wearing a purple collar on which hung a small bell that chimed every time he moved. &#x201c;My services do not come cheap,&#x201d; he said.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;When the job is done, you&#x2019;ll get more than you could ever desire,&#x201d; Titus said.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I can desire a lot,&#x201d; Sixclaw answered. &#x201c;A cat&#x2019;s appetites are bottomless.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you can whet your appetite with this little bird here,&#x201d; said Titus. The bird&#x2019;s eyes widened, and the cat grinned from ear to ear. His pink tongue danced across his razor-sharp teeth.&nbsp;<br><br>Titus turned to go, picking his way back over the strewn garbage and overgrown grass of the alley, cautious with every placement of his paws. He hated to visit this filthy place and hated to do business with cats like Sixclaw, who were half wild in spite of their collars and dishes of milk left out on porches. Sometimes unpleasant alliances were necessary, even between cats and dogs. They were on the same side after all, when it came to ridding themselves of the vermin of Ankle Snap Alley.&nbsp;<br><br>As he left the cat and his prey behind, he turned his head back with a jingle of dog tags. &#x201c;When you eat the bird, leave his head for the vermin to find,&#x201d; he called back. &#x201c;As a warning from the Flealess. Their time is up.&#x201d;</p><h2>Halloween</h2><p>Luminous, haunting illustrations of three trick-or-treaters&#39; moonlit revels capture the spooky, spine-tingling thrill of this magical night.</p><p>Harry Behn (1898-1973) was born in Prescott, Arizona. He attended Stanford University and Harvard University, and worked as a Hollywood scriptwriter and a college professor. He was the founding editor of the Arizona Quarterly , founder of the University of Arizona Press and the Phoenix Little Theatre. He wrote numerous children&#39;s novels, several of which he also illustrated, and seven books of verse for young readers.Gr. 2-3. The palette, dark and misty and mottled with reflected light, perfectly fits this imaginative book in which an eerily fantastic story evolves into a joyous, unusual celebration. The artful text ("When dead leaves fly / like witches on switches / cross the sky") sometimes set against backgrounds so dark that the words nearly disappear, follows the progress of three costumed children delighted to be out trick-or-treating. They laugh and revel in the spooky night until flickering lights transform the shadowy landscape into spooks, ghouls, and witches. The play of shadow and light is remarkable, with dreamy, atmospheric double-spreads that are truly eerie at times. But despite the shadows and strange denizens of the night, the trick-or-treaters have things well in hand, and by the end they join their hosts in dancing "round their queen." After all, "it's Halloween." Save this for children old enough to handle the chills and sharp enough to appreciate the subtle, comic outcome that turns the mood completely around. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Worn worldwide, it is cherished both for the clothing made from it and as a fascinating traditional craft. <b>Lara Platman</b> spent a year with the farmers, mill workers, weavers, tailors and designers who are carrying this tradition forward into the twenty-first century and in <i>Harris Tweed: From Land to Street</i> she follows the chain of craftsmen, from the islanders in the Hebrides to the tailors of Savile Row. With an eye for character, colour and light, and an ear for a good story, Lara has created extraordinary portraits of these living national treasures, complemented by evocative images of the landscapes of Harris, the tweed patterns whose textures and colours seem to emerge from the land, and the use of Harris tweed in the work of fashion designers including Vivienne Westwood, Margaret Howell and Paul Smith.Offering insights into a lifestyle whose continued existence may surprise many, this group portrait is a heartfelt celebration of craftsmanship and a way of life.</p></p><p><b>Lara Platman</b> is a photographer and writer, specialising in documenting areas of culture that are often considered to be eccentric or endangered. Coming from a family who produced theatrical costumes, she has grown up around creative craftsmen.

Sometimes referred to as the Harlem Globetrotters of baseball&#x2014;though many of the Globetrotters&#x2019; routines were borrowed directly from the Clowns&#x2014;they captured the affection of Americans of all ethnicities and classes. <br>Alan Pollock&#x2019;s father, Syd, owned the Clowns, as well as a series of black barnstorming teams that crisscrossed the country from the late 1920s until the mid-1960s. They played every venue imaginable, from little league fields to Yankee Stadium, and toured the South, the Northeast, the Midwest, the Canadian Rockies, the Dakotas, the Southwest, the Far West&#x2014;anywhere there was a crowd willing to shell out a few dollars for an unforgettable evening. <br>Alan grew up around the team and describes in vivid detail the comedy routines of Richard &#x201c;King Tut&#x201d; King, &#x201c;Spec Bebob&#x201d; Bell, Reece &#x201c;Goose&#x201d; Tatum; the &#x201c;warpaint&#x201d; and outlandish costumes worn by players in the early days; and the crowd-pleasing displays of amazing skill known as pepperball and shadowball. These men were entertainers, but they were also among the most gifted athletes of their day, making a living in sports the only way a black man could. They played to win. <br>More than just a baseball story, these recollections tell the story of great societal changes in America from the roaring twenties, through the years of the Great Depression and World War II, and into the Civil Rights era. &nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Alan Pollock</b> was editing this manuscript when he suffered a sudden and fatal heart attack. His widow approached longtime friend, and author of <i>The Biographical Encyclopedia of the Negro Baseball Leagues, </i><b>James A. Riley, </b>to complete the project.Normal0falsefalsefalseMicrosoftInternetExplorer4<br><br> "This delightful offering about the infamous African American traveling baseball team of the 1920s-60s, the Indianapolis Clowns, is equal parts memoir and history. As the son of the owner of the Clowns, Pollock was in a unique position to offer insights, recollections, and period photographs. Sadly, he died while the book was in the final stages, and Riley (a noted Negro Leagues historian) completed the project. The Clowns were the Harlem Globetrotters of baseball for decades, bringing their unique brand of skill and raucous entertainment to far-flung corners of North America. Players with colorful names like King Tut, Kalihari Evans, Impo Barnhill, Piggy Sands, and Spec Bebop took the field in colorful costumes--anything from grass skirts to Indian war paint and feathers--and displayed their true skills with baseball sleight-of-hand exhibitions that kept the crowds coming back for more. Organized chronologically, the book is a pleasing mixture of narrative history and personal anecdotes. In contrast to other Negro League history books on the market, this one contains no footnotes, endnotes, or bibliography. Still, readers interested in baseball or American social history will likely be intrigued by Pollock's tale.&nbsp;&nbsp;Summing Up: Recommended. All readers; all levels."<br> &#x2014;<i>CHOICE</i><br>&#x201c;Syd Pollock&#x2019;s son, Alan, grew up with the Clowns and worked for his father in various capacities. Alan finished drafting <i>Barnstorming to Heaven</i> shortly before his death, and veteran baseball writer James Riley edited the manuscript and shepherded it through publication. Alan Pollock lovingly recounted the routines of King Tut and the Clowns and recorded a treasure trove of anecdotes. His insider&#x2019;s account of the business side of baseball barnstormers is fascinating and illustrated by a superb collection of photographs. <i>Barnstorming to Heaven</i> is excellent baseball history, a must for every fan&#x2019;s bookshelf.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Alabama Review</i><br><br>Normal 0 false false false MicrosoftInternetExplorer4 st1\:*{behavior:url(#ieooui) } /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:""; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-ansi-language:#0400; mso-fareast-language:#0400; mso-bidi-language:#0400;} <br><br> &#x201c;It is part memoir and part history of the country&#x2019;s most successful barn-storming baseball team, a changing group of black ballplayers, including three women, who attracted fans for their inspired clowning, but who were also dazzlingly accomplished players.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Boston</i><i> Sunday Globe</i><br><br>&#x201c;This is a fond farewell to baseball&#x2019;s barnstorming tradition and its greatest proponet, Syd Pollock of the Indianapolis Clowns.

As the Nazis move closer to the country, it is decided that something must be done to keep Norwegian gold from the enemy. Children are the only ones who can go about their daily lives without arousing suspicion. Narrator McDonough uses restraint as he retells this compelling story about REAL heros and heroines. The pace of the story and McDonough&#39;s style keep the listener on edge as the children hide gold bricks in the snowmen they are building right under the German noses. McDonough&#39;s mature and accentless voice is perfect since the story is filled with many nationalities and ages. A superb choice for older children and anyone interested in WWII lore. S.G.B.

With a new foreword for the American edition.</b> <br><br> There may be no cultural practice more global than soccer. Rites of birth and marriage are infinitely diverse, but the rules of soccer are universal. No world religion can match its geographical scope. The single greatest simultaneous human collective experience is the World Cup final. <br><br> In this extraordinary tour de force, David Goldblatt tells the full story of soccer's rise from chaotic folk ritual to the world's most popular sport-now poised to fully establish itself in the USA. Already celebrated internationally, <i>The Ball Is Round</i> illuminates soccer's role in the political and social histories of modern societies, but never loses sight of the beauty, joy, and excitement of the game itself. <p></p> <p> <strong>Questions for David Goldblatt</strong> </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> There's a sentence in the middle of <i>The Ball Is Round</i> that to me sums up a great deal of the culture of football. After noting that Pel� had scored nearly a goal a game in over 1,300 professional matches--the sort of stat that would be on every page in a history of one of the major American sports but that is very rare in this one--you write, "This of course tells us nothing about all the goals he made." What stories do football fans tell about their sport and their stars? </p><p> <strong>Goldblatt:</strong> Well, in America not only would you be banging on about Pele's goal to game ratio but you would have been collecting statistics in a rational organized manner about his assists--a concept that had only entered soccer statistics in the last few years. The state of Brazilian football statistics during Pel�'s career would not pass muster in Cooperstown in can tell you. Bill James would have a nervous breakdown with hopeless state of the data base. Soccer fans tell a lot the same stories that Americans tell themselves, sagas, epics, heroic tasks, near misses, dramatic comebacks, tales of curious individualists and unshakeable teams, but they are told in a the idioms, genres, vocabulary, and head space of hundreds of different cultures. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> I have to ask the inevitable question: why hasn't football--rather, soccer--ever taken hold in the United States (despite generations now who grow up playing it)? (And does the rest of the world care if it ever does?) I was fascinated by your comment in the American foreword that you recovered from finishing the book by ignoring soccer for half a year and only watching American sports. What did you notice? </p><p> <strong>Goldblatt:</strong> Contrary to the received wisdom I would say that soccer has taken hold in the US, if we look at participation figures amongst women and the young, and while MLS isn't about to challenge the premiership or Serie A for money or glamour it looks like it is now established on a firm footing. If the game can just tap into the rising Latino communities of America it could be pushing hockey for fourth sport.</p><p> That said it would still be just number 4. Baseball, football, and basketball have now had over a century's head start on soccer and between them created a wider sports culture--of expectations, tastes, and pleasures--that I think sometimes finds soccer incomprehensible ( what's with the draws?) or distasteful (all that diving). Soccer had its chance in the USA in the 1920s and 30s when East Coast professional leagues were drawing big crowds but a combination of bureaucratic infighting, the Wall Street crash, and the lingering ethnic associations of the game killed it for two generations.</p><p> My time with American sports, which I should add is far from over, wasn't planned. After the 2006 World Cup I just couldn't watch any more soccer and there was an awfully big space in my brain where that used to go on. <i>Moneyball</i> by Michael Lewis came into the void and that took me to Jules Tygiel and the great tradition of baseball histories, Ken Burns's long documentary which enchanted me (watched the whole thing in two days) and by the time I had read Roger Angell and stopped laughing, discovered Jackie Robinson, DiMaggio's Streak, and the Shot Heard Round the World it was time to subscribe to NASN and watch the last two months of the 2006 season. If you like the places where culture, society, sport, and history intersect then you're going to like baseball. I'm still working on hockey, in fact I'm still working on seeing the puck, and I'm trying hard to understand football--but I'm finding the helmets, amongst other things, a problem.</p><p> What did I notice? Where do I begin? After barely thinking about the United States for three and half years the whole modern history of America opened up before me. That's a work in progress. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> It's hard to underestimate the density and breadth of knowledge that went into this book: politics, culture, and of course football, across the entire football-playing world (which is to say, the entire world). How did you research your vast topic? </p><p><strong>Goldblatt:</strong> <i>The Ball Is Round</i> was, in retrospect, 20 years in the making. I had wanted to write a world history since I knew that such things existed. In a former life I spent a long time working on globalization and global history and then I made a global atlas of football, so I had plenty of background.</p><p> After that, I followed Phillip Pullman's advice, "Read like a butterfly, write like a bee." I read a lot, followed my nose and other's advice, scoured journals, libraries and old magazines, studied web sites, visited museums, stadia, and shrines, made contacts in a lot of countries, and begged, bought, and traded information and opinion--oh and I watched an awful lot of football.</p><p> There were trips to Scotland, Sweden, Serbia, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Greece, Tunisia, Uruguay, Brazil, and Argentina not to mention a lot of old games on video and DVD.</p><p> How did I write it? Fast. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> There is nearly as much politics in your history as football--among Argentines, for instance, Peron has nearly as many index entries as Maradona. Why did you not want to write a history only of the players and the games? What relationship do you see between football and politics? </p><p> <strong>Goldblatt:</strong> How could anyone write a history of just players and games and be true to the meaning of soccer? Milan Kundera defended the role of the literary critic by arguing "Without the meditative background that is criticism, works become isolated gestures, historical accidents, soon forgotten." I would say the same of same of social history and sport. All sports trade on their histories, but tend to offer us at best the anodyne accounts of their own development and meanings at worst they are scurrilous cover-ups and concocted myth. Sport and its audience deserve better.</p><p> The relationship between football and politics takes many forms--it has been entwined with every conceivable political ideology and movement, every geographical unit and social division, and it has served authoritarian and democratic visions. In the end, football will take on and express the politics determined by our collective choices and struggles, the point for me is to remember that one has choices; to some extent we get the soccer we deserve. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Has modern football become too big for itself, between the tycoons and the multinationals, the giant audiences and transfer fees, the corruption and the endless media coverage? Is there still space for the game? </p><p> <strong>Goldblatt:</strong> I went to see Manchester United last year in the Champions league--a 70th birthday present for my Mancunian father-in-law--and here at the epicenter of the global branding revolution and the foreign takeover and the rest of it I was privileged to see Carlos Tevez take the game by the scruff of the neck and force 21 players and 70,000 people to track his every move--electric.</p><p> Come to Bristol, England's most underperforming soccer city (half a million people, two clubs, no titles) and tell me there's no space for the game. No one is going to Bristol Rovers to be part of giant audience or a world shaped by tycoons and multinationals. But go they do, and to Bristol City too, teetering on the edge of the premiership and there I find a game that makes me laugh--soccer does pantomime and farce here--but surprises, thrills, and reminds me as part of a living crowd the one thing that writing a world history really drives home--"we are all just a drop in the ocean." </p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> And lastly: who's your favorite for Euro 2008? <p> <strong>Goldblatt:</strong> It feels really open--so I'm going with an outsider (like Greece at 2004)--Croatia. </p>David Goldblatt was born in 1965 and inherited, for his sins, Tottenham Hotspurs from his father. His books include Social Theory and the Environment, Global Transformations and the World Football Yearbook. He currently lives in Bristol, the Bermuda triangle of football prowess, where he spreads his affections amongst Spurs, Bristol Rovers and Bristol City.</p><h2>Jump-Start Your Own Quilting</h2><p>Featuring patterns for shoulder bags, totes, wallets, pillows, runners, aprons, dog coats, and wall quilts, this resource offers quilters a quick way to make complete works by using precut fabrics.

Yet today, science and its practitioners have come under political attack. In this fascinating history spanning continents and centuries, historian David Wootton offers a lively defense of science, revealing why the Scientific Revolution was truly the greatest event in our history.</p><p><em>The Invention of Science</em> goes back five hundred years in time to chronicle this crucial transformation, exploring the factors that led to its birth and the people who made it happen. Wootton argues that the Scientific Revolution was actually five separate yet concurrent events that developed independently, but came to intersect and create a new worldview. Here are the brilliant iconoclasts&#x2014;Galileo, Copernicus, Brahe, Newton, and many more curious minds from across Europe&#x2014;whose studies of the natural world challenged centuries of religious orthodoxy and ingrained superstition.</p><p>From gunpowder technology, the discovery of the new world, movable type printing, perspective painting, and the telescope to the practice of conducting experiments, the laws of nature, and the concept of the fact, Wotton shows how these discoveries codified into a social construct and a system of knowledge. Ultimately, he makes clear the link between scientific discovery and the rise of industrialization&#x2014;and the birth of the modern world we know.</p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of December 2015:</strong> Here&#x2019;s a big, fat history of science (spanning from 1572 to 1704) with a very clear thesis: that science, and thus the world, entered the modern age during this precise span. Wooton, the Anniversary Professor of History at the University of York, explores primary texts and detailed history to build his argument that Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe&#x2019;s discovery of a new star in 1572 started a scientific revolution, and that Isaac Newton&#x2019;s 1704 publication of <em>Opticks</em> sealed it. What happened in between was a series of discoveries&#x2014;of gunpowder, movable type, the New World, etc.&#x2014;that altered our perception of <em>what is</em> and, through the Newtonian Revolution, opened our minds to <em>what might be</em>. The sheer size of the book allows readers to jump around between essays, but taken as a whole <em>The Invention of Science</em> builds a powerful, thoroughly fascinating argument ripe for debate. --<em>Chris Schluep</em></p><p>We live in a world made by science. How and when did this happen? <em>The Invention of Science</em> tells the story of the extraordinary intellectual and cultural revolution that gave birth to modern science, and mounts a major challenge to the prevailing orthodoxy of its history.</p><p>Before 1492, all significant knowledge was believed to be already available; there was no concept of progress, as people looked to the past, not the future, for understanding. David Wootton argues that the discovery of America demonstrated that new knowledge was possible: indeed, it introduced the very concept of discovery and opened the way to the invention of science.</p><p>The first crucial discovery was Tycho Brahe&#x2019;s nova of 1572: proof that there could be change in the heavens. The invention of the telescope in 1608 rendered the old astronomy obsolete. Evangelista Torricelli&#x2019;s experiment with the vacuum in 1643 led directly to the triumph of the experimental method in the Royal Society of Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton. By 1750, Newtonianism was being celebrated throughout Europe.</p><p>This new science did not consist simply of new discoveries or methods. It relied on a new understanding of what knowledge may be, and with this came a fresh language: <em>discovery</em>, <em>progress</em>, <em>fact</em>, <em>experiment</em>, <em>hypothesis</em>, <em>theory</em>, <em>laws of nature</em>. Although almost all these terms existed before 1492, their meanings were radically transformed, and they became tools to think scientifically. Now we all speak this language of science that was invented during the Scientific Revolution.</p><p>This revolution had its martyrs (Bruno, Galileo), its heroes (Kepler, Boyle), its propagandists (Voltaire, Diderot), and its patient laborers (Gilbert, Hooke). The new culture led to a new rationalism, killing off alchemy, astrology, and the belief in witchcraft. It also led to the invention of the steam engine and to the first Industrial Revolution. Wootton&#x2019;s landmark work changes our understanding of how this great transformation came about, and of what science is.</p></p><h2>Letters to a Brother Priest</h2><p>Message of Hope for all who are weary from living in a world filled with chaos.</p><p></p><h2>Green Shingles: At the Edge of Chesapeake Bay</h2><p>Painter and writer Svenson and his wife moved to what had once been a huge amusement park on a 40-bluff coastal bluff ten miles across the water from Baltimore.

HMS Rattlesnake, an ageing British warship, was commissioned in 1846 to survey this magnificent &#39;Coral Sea&#39; and to produce the first detailed chart of the New Guinea coast. Every reef, every shoal, every rock hazard has to be located and mapped with extreme accuracy. At stake was the pre-eminence of British sea power - and the ambitions of those on board. If all went well Stanley, the ship&#39;s brilliant captain, could expect a top job in the Admiralty; MacGillivray, the gifted naturalist, would be the world&#39;s expert on the fauna of Australia and the unknown New Guinea; and Thomas Huxley (destined to become the most famous proponent of evolutionary theory after Darwin and grandfather of Aldous Huxley), the ambitious young surgeon, could abandon the dreary routine of the naval service for the excitement of the new world of science. But a series of highly dramatic events and encounters ensures that by the time the Rattlesnake finally returns to England, the glorious dreams of at least some of her crew have met with tragedy...</p><p>Jordan Goodman is an Honorary Research Fellow in the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London.

This updated edition draws on the 2007 Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Girls and Women to examine feminist therapy theory and captures the richness of new research throughout, especially in the burgeoning research areas of hormonal influences on behavior, ambivalent sexism, and body objectification. As with the previous editions, Women and Gender remains sensitive to intersectionality and the social construction of gender. It takes a holistic, dynamic approach that blends understandings of biology, socialization, aging, individual differences, and social contexts, including stereotyping and social status. Building on these understandings, it explores women&#39;s relationships, employment, body image, physical and mental health, male violence against girls and women, and women&#39;s power and empowerment.</p><p>Jan Yoder earned her doctorate in psychology in 1979 from the State University of New York at Buffalo. Her interests in women, gender, and feminism developed professionally through her observations of the first women cadets at West Point and personally through her own struggles with sexual harassment, dual-career challenges, work-family juggling, and women s universal exposure to sexism. Her job paths traveled a circuitous but enlightening route through West Point, where she stood out as one of the first two civilian women to teach there; through a small student-centered college in St. Louis, Webster University; through an exhilarating foray into the world of advertising and marketing research in Chicago at DDB Needham Worldwide; to large research-oriented universities in Milwaukee and finally Akron. The wealth of these diverse experiences comes through in this book as she blends a strong research base with her sensitivity to women s and men s everyday lives and with an engaging style that comes from teaching for over 30 years in a variety of college and university settings. Her teaching has been recognized with the Heritage Award for Distinguished, Longstanding, and Substantial Contributions to Feminist Teaching from the Society for the Psychology of Women (SPW; APA, Division 35) in 2006, with the Teacher-Scholar Award from the University of Akron in 2008, and with both university (1994) and college (1996) distinguished teaching awards at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Her involvement in research culminated in 2010 when she became Editor of Psychology of Women Quarterly, the official journal of SPW published by Sage, which put her at the cutting edge of reviewing feminist research an ideal vantage from which to write this text. Her service to SPW, spanning over two decades, was recognized in 2010 with the Sue Rosenberg Zalk Award for Distinguished Service service that includes being President of SPW in 2000-2001 as well as secretary, program chair, newsletter editor, and other assorted positions. She continues to live in Akron, Ohio with her soul-mate, sociologist John Zipp, and is deeply proud of her children as they work toward finishing graduate school (Kate) and college (Dan).

Issued in tandem with <i>Kitty</i>, the revealing autobiography of his wife, Kitty Carlisle Hart,<i> Act One</i>, is a landmark memoir that incluenced a generation of theatergoers, dramatists, and general book readers everywhere. The book eloquently chronicles Moss Hart's impoverished childhood in the Bronx and Brooklyn and his long, determined struggle to his first theatreical Broadway success, <i>Once in a Lifetime</i>. One of the most celebrated American theater books of the twentieth centure and a glorious memorial to a bygone age, <i>Act One</i> if filled with all the wonder, drama, and heartbreak that surrounded Broadway in the 1920s and the years before World War II.</p></p><p>Moss Hart was in the thick of American theater when everyone wore black tie on opening night and the world&#39;s most witty people entertained each other around a grand piano at late-night supper parties. It&#39;s an era of glamour that will never come again, but we have Hart&#39;s words on paper, and that is no small thing. A renowned director and theatrical collaborator, the brilliant Hart died too soon after the curtain went up on Act Two. If you want to know what it was like to be on the inside track in NYC in the &#39;30s, &#39;40s and &#39;50s, here&#39;s a good place to find out.In the opinion of the publishers, act one is the warmest, most engrossing?and by far the most revealing?book about the theatre that they have ever encountered.<br>It is, of course, a success story, for Moss Hart today is one of the most brilliant, successful and famous figures in the American theatre, both as a playwright and as a director.<br>How did it happen? Not easily. His boyhood and adolescent years were spent in two entirely different backgrounds, and the stories of both are fascinating. With the opening of his first Broadway play, Once in a Lifetime, his world changed abruptly. This book concludes with a detailed telling of the complicated steps whereby that play came into being. <br>?I consider the memories and pledges that were part of the struggle that preceded success the vital ones,? the author says. He has set these memories down with unusual candor, humor and excitement; and the book is an intimate and informative portrait, not only of him self but of the world of the theatre as well.</p><h2>Bach -- The Well-Tempered Clavier, Vol 1: Comb Bound Book (Alfred Masterwork CD Edition)</h2><p>A most impressive edition of the first volume of &#34;The Well-Tempered Clavier,&#34; these 24 preludes and fugues were painstakingly researched over a period of 10 years, using the most important original manuscript sources.

Several of the contributors focus on European culture as a repository of harem representations, but most of them tackle indigenous representations of home spaces and their significance for how the bodies of men and women, and girls and boys, were distributed in social space, from early Islamic Mecca to early-twentieth-century Cairo.<p></p><p>Contributors.

Underlying the cleavage are primal myths, deeper histories, and political folk-legends.

He charts how the NHS is coping with the twin burdens of austerity and an aging population.<br><br> <i>Dreams of Leaving and Remaining</i> is urgent reporting from one of Britain&#x2019;s finest journalists.

The nation's safety net is pulling apart under its own weight; political compromise is viewed as a form of defeat; and our faith in the enduring concept of American exceptionalism appears increasingly outdated.</p><p>But the American Age may not be ending. In <em>The Vanishing Neighbor</em>, Marc J. Dunkelman identifies an epochal shift in the structure of American life&#x2015;a shift unnoticed by many. Routines that once put doctors and lawyers in touch with grocers and plumbers&#x2015;interactions that encouraged debate and cultivated compromise&#x2015;have changed dramatically since the postwar era. Both technology and the new routines of everyday life connect tight-knit circles and expand the breadth of our social landscapes, but they've sapped the commonplace, incidental interactions that for centuries have built local communities and fostered healthy debate.</p><p>The disappearance of these once-central relationships&#x2015;between people who are familiar but not close, or friendly but not intimate&#x2015;lies at the root of America's economic woes and political gridlock. The institutions that were erected to support what Tocqueville called the "township"&#x2015;that unique locus of the power of citizens&#x2015;are failing because they haven't yet been molded to the realities of the new American community.</p><p>It's time we moved beyond the debate over whether the changes being made to American life are good or bad and focus instead on understanding the tradeoffs. Our cities are less racially segregated than in decades past, but we&#x2019;ve become less cognizant of what's happening in the lives of people from different economic backgrounds, education levels, or age groups. Familiar divisions have been replaced by cross-cutting networks&#x2015;with profound effects for the way we resolve conflicts, spur innovation, and care for those in need.</p><p>The good news is that the very transformation at the heart of our current anxiety holds the promise of more hope and prosperity than would have been possible under the old order. <em>The Vanishing Neighbor</em> argues persuasively that to win the future we need to adapt yesterday&#x2019;s institutions to the realities of the twenty-first-century American community.</p></p><p>Marc J. Dunkelman is a Research Fellow at Brown University&#x2019;s A. Alfred Taubman Center for Public Policy and American Institutions and a Senior Fellow at the Clinton Foundation. His writing has appeared in the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, Politico, and National Affairs, among other publications. He lives in Providence, Rhode Island.&#x201c;Marc Dunkelman gets it. In <em>The Vanishing Neighbor</em>, he shows how the traditional web of relationships that makes up American life is undergoing fundamental change, why it matters, and what we need to do about it.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>President Bill Clinton</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Important... provide[s] fresh thoughts about community in the United States that might win assent from left and right alike.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>E.J. Dionne Jr., <em>Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A highly ambitious, wide-ranging book that offers important new insights into why the bonds of community have unraveled in America in the past generation.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Alan Ehrenhalt, author of <em>The Great Inversion</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In <em>The Vanishing Neighbor</em>, Marc Dunkelman conducts us insightfully through the work of astute sociologists and other observers of American social life, from the time in the 1950s when they described a conformist and confident society to the confused and more uncertain period of today. He focuses on one significant change: the transformation of the American 'township,' a defining characteristic of American society since Tocqueville first identified it, into something quite different. As Dunkelman ably shows, rapid economic change, the digital revolution, and other factors have fundamentally altered our social life, our political life, and our ability to solve the problems of a rapidly changing society.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Nathan Glazer, professor emeritus of sociology and education, Harvard University</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>The Vanishing Neighbor</em> is an urgent, challenging, strongly reasoned argument about the health of American society. Marc Dunkelman speaks directly to the communication gap between our local communities and the governments that serve them. How we bridge that gap&#x2015;as working people, as political leaders, and as neighbors&#x2015;will determine the care we provide to our loved ones and the opportunities we leave our children for years to come.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Neera Tanden, president, Center for American Progress</strong><br><br>&#x201c;After a panoramic view of how the United States has changed in so many ways, Marc Dunkelman argues that Americans are left with a sense of isolation from neighbors nearby: we keep 'inner-ring' relationships with family and close friends plus 'outer-ring' with Facebook friends we see infrequently, but we have lost middle-ring relationships with families down the street and a barber around the corner. Institutions, Dunkelman believes, must adapt to these new realities, nourishing a fresh sense of community. This is an insightful call for remembering what Tocqueville found best about America.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>David Gergen, codirector of the Center for Public Leadership and professor of public service at Harvard Kennedy School and senior political analyst, CNN</strong><br><br>&#x201c;A meditation on the evaporation of American exceptionalism... thought-provoking [and] evenhanded.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A rich and accessible diagnosis of contemporary mores and discontents.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong></p><h2>Bob Marley and the Wailers</h2><p>THE DEFINITIVE DISCOGRAPHY OF THE UNDISPUTED KING OF REGGAE FROM ACKNOWLEDGED EXPERTS World-renowned Marley expert Roger Steffens and noted black music scholar Leroy Pierson collaborate to bring readers an unparalleled compendium.

The dominant mainstream philosophy is now scientific objectivism, which describes a universe that exists for no reason and a life that ends in oblivion. <br><br>Pioneering philosopher Tim Freke addresses the "soul crisis" in modern culture that has arisen from lack of meaning. He offers an intelligent "spiritual" perspective on life and death to help us make sense of a paradoxical world, which is sometimes bleak and banal, but also can be magical and full of significance. He presents a revolutionary paradigm shift in our understanding of reality that integrates the deepest insights of science and spirituality to create a new model of human identity, which makes the idea of the immortal soul intellectually credible. <br><br>He explores the process of evolution, not as blind chance, but as the momentous story of the self-realising universe. The development of the material world has led to the emergence of "psyche" or "soul," which you are experiencing right now as a stream of thoughts and images that don't exist in space and aren't made of matter. <br><br>We are not insignificant specks in a vast purposeless cosmos. We are significant participants in the magnificent and meaningful story of soul. The universe is coming to know itself through each one of us and this process doesn't end at death, because the evolution of soul has also been the evolution of immortality.</p><p><b>Tim Freke&nbsp;</b>is an internationally respected authority on world spirituality and the bestselling author of more than 20 books, which have been translated into 15 languages.

The instant recognition of Marie&#x2019;s name, and her reputation as the victim of an unhappy arranged marriage, have become lost to subsequent generations, but her rocky nuptial road mirrors that of countless royal spouses.</p><p>Naturally, their ancient and venerated families expected these unions to be glorious&#x2014;conferring additional distinction or fame upon their respective dynasties&#x2014;not to mention &#x201c;glorious&#x201d; as in &#x201c;magnificent&#x201d; and &#x201c;grand.&#x201d; But all too often, the opposite occurred, and the royal marriages that began with such high hopes for the couple and the kingdom became <i>in</i>glorious&#x2014;bringing shame and dishonor to one or both partners. Their marriages, and by extension their families, were instead disgraced by scandal and reduced to ignominy. Some of the unions profiled in this book were viewed at the time as inglorious because traditional gender roles were reversed, with wives assuming the reins of power. Or because they failed to fulfill their primary contractual duty by remaining childless for years. Or both.</p><p>Because these royal unions were intended to be political and dynastic strategic alliances, nearly all of them were arranged, even through the Victorian era and beyond. No one expected the spouses to be <i>in</i> love, or even to love each other, and yet their families and friends would always act surprised when the man and wife barely got along and the marriage failed. A much-anticipated &#x201c;glorious&#x201d; life of glamour, wealth, and power was doomed or destroyed, not only by such connubial disasters as adultery or infertility, but by the banalities of real life and the natural emotional reactions to marital neglect. The only reason so many of these unions lasted was because divorce was invariably unthinkable or legally unattainable. The rare royal divorces brought scandal and disgrace on the entire dynasty. As Czar Nicholas II opined&#x2014;at the end of the nineteenth century&#x2014;when two of his first cousins horrified the family by calling it a day, the death of a dear loved one would have been preferable to a divorce. One wonders whether Nicholas might have felt differently had <i>he</i> been trapped in a miserable union instead of having the good fortune of wedding his one true love.</p><p>Every royal marriage in this volume makes the hit parade of history&#x2019;s myriad mismatches. And as much as it&#x2019;s true that some marriages were more terrible than others, it&#x2019;s hardly surprising that there were so many bad ones; several of the girls were only in their mid-teens when their parents sacrificed them on the altar of matrimony to grooms who were total strangers, barely older than their brides. For centuries, this practice was not considered unusual. Even nowadays, some couples do wed in their late teens. But they usually know each other before they get hitched; and, being commoners, their responsibilities scarcely compare to those of young royals of centuries past.</p><p>The idea that these mere adolescents were routinely expected to make the weighty decisions required of governing a kingdom, to lead armies, set policy, and be the arbiters of the nation in fashion and culture is mind-boggling today. Their brains had not yet fully matured; how could they have the requisite judgment to wisely rule? By the time these children&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s what they were&#x2014;had wed at the age of fifteen or sixteen, they had reached their legal, if not emotional, adulthood, and no longer had a regent to do the heavy lifting. Yes, they had ministers, and in some situations there was a parliament, but the monarch had a tremendous amount of authority and, in many cases, the last word.</p><p>When you add to the burden of king- or queenship that of parenthood at such a tender age, as well as the fact that there was usually no rapport between the spouses, it&#x2019;s no wonder so many of these marriages were miserable. But what if there were no children&#x2014;a different problem altogether? Royal wives had one major duty, even if they were the rulers: to bear an heir for the kingdom. When trouble in the bedroom, for any number of reasons, resulted in childlessness for an extended number of years, or even for the duration of the marriage, it was the wife who was blamed. She could be sent back to her native land in humiliated disgrace or shoved into a convent and forced to become an abbess&#x2014;the inglorious marriage annulled so that her husband could try again with a more potentially fertile womb. The world would know that she had failed her spouse, her family, and her country.</p><p>More often, however, the couples remained together, although some wives might have found one of the prior alternatives preferable to the daily torment they endured within their marriage. Royal women were expected to accept their husband&#x2019;s behavior, no matter what he did. If he strayed, whether from frustration, disinterest in her, or a hyperactive libido, not only did propriety demand that she remain faithful to him nonetheless, but she was to turn a blind eye to his infidelities. Some wives even had to tolerate the presence of their husband&#x2019;s paramours at court, or worse, within their households, feigning cordiality in public while dwelling in a private hell they could never reveal. It often mortified them to be gracious to their husband&#x2019;s mistresses, and sapped their dignity day by day. Imagine the emotional and psychological cost. But part and parcel of the woman&#x2019;s role was to put up, shut up, and bear an heir&#x2014;to be the well-dressed womb with no point of view.</p><p>And when she crossed the invisible boundaries prescribed for her sex by evincing an interest in affairs of state or any area perceived to be a man&#x2019;s sphere, including having the temerity to question her husband&#x2019;s extramarital infidelities, she was cast as hysterical, a harridan, or an unnatural woman. Society was rarely kind to females, but in many ways, royal women enjoyed an even narrower world with fewer choices than commoners. They could not seek employment or professionally practice a craft. They might become patrons of artists, industries, or charities, but could never be entrepreneurs. It was imperative for a royal wife to be charming and gracious, but if she was outspoken or had strong opinions, she was viewed as a meddler. She was supposed to be elegant, but if she was too glamorous or flamboyant, she was derided for behaving like a royal mistress.</p><p>Yet many of the queens and other first ladies of their respective realms managed to overcome their marital disappointments in a variety of ways, from taking the reins of power to indulging in adulterous affairs. The aforementioned Marie of Roumania, who was compelled by her mother to wed her jug-eared, shy, unassertive, and boring cousin Ferdinand, became the &#x201c;face&#x201d; of her little-known country during the First World War, regaining massive swaths of land during the peace talks at Versailles through her personal charm and what I have dubbed &#x201c;couture diplomacy&#x201d;&#x2014;simply knowing the right thing to wear!</p><p>Others became warrior queens like Margaret of Anjou; yoked to the childlike Henry VI of England, whose sudden paralytic illness rendered him incapable of ruling his realm, she raised an army during the Wars of the Roses, hell-bent on saving her husband&#x2019;s throne.</p><p>Some royals were united with men who batted for the other team: For Marie of Roumania&#x2019;s younger sister Victoria Melita, known as &#x201c;Ducky,&#x201d; things didn&#x2019;t go so swimmingly in the marriage bed. Her first husband, also a first cousin, the Grand Duke of Hesse, preferred footmen and stable boys&#x2014;which was less of a scandal than Ducky&#x2019;s subsequent divorce and elopement with another first cousin, a Russian grand duke! The hypocrisy is astounding. Until very recently, divorced persons were personae non grata at the English court and were not even permitted into the Royal Box at Ascot, although for centuries, known adulterers swanned about with impunity within the royal inner circle.</p><p>During the seventeenth century, Charles II&#x2019;s beautiful, high-spirited sister &#x201c;Minette&#x201d; wed the younger brother of Louis XIV, her French cousin Philippe d&#x2019;Orl�ans, a man who wore more makeup and perfume than she did. Although the duc d&#x2019;Orl�ans was able to fulfill his marital duty with Minette, when she died young he didn&#x2019;t find it as easy to propagate with his second wife, a butch-looking, zaftig German princess. One night, she caught him hanging holy medals about his genitalia, insisting that the hardware enabled him to rise to the necessary level of performance. Philippe&#x2019;s father, Anne of Austria&#x2019;s husband, Louis XIII of France, wasn&#x2019;t particularly interested in women either. It took nearly a quarter century before Anne bore an heir. Although there were a number of miscarriages, absent a live birth <i>she</i> was blamed for the problems in the boudoir, and stigmatized for her barrenness.</p><p>In some marriages, the love was hopelessly one-sided. Both England&#x2019;s Mary I (Henry VIII&#x2019;s older daughter, known as &#x201c;Bloody Mary&#x201d;) and the diminutive Portuguese-born princess Catherine of Braganza were tragically in love with their husbands. But their respective spouses, Philip II of Spain and Charles II, never returned their affection. Nicknamed the &#x201c;Merry Monarch&#x201d; for the jubilant and libidinous era inaugurated by his Restoration of the monarchy, Charles went so far as to flaunt his numerous mistresses in front of his love-struck wife for the duration of their twenty-three-year marriage! And Henry VIII&#x2019;s elder sister Margaret Tudor was the dupe of not one but <i>three</i> husbands who were incapable of fidelity.</p><p>At least these women survived to complain about their mistreatment&#x2014;unlike Lady Jane Grey, wed against her will, and a victim of her parents&#x2019; and in-laws&#x2019; ambition. Ditto the two gorgeous Medici princesses Isabella Romola de Medici and Eleonora di Garzia di Toledo, who learned the hard way that in Renaissance Italy powerful husbands could behave with impunity&#x2014;their wives&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not so much.</p><p>Italian men created their own rules, as Marie Antoinette&#x2019;s elder sister Maria Carolina learned when she wed Ferdinand IV, king of Naples. She had no choice but to feign amusement when he dumped hot pasta on their subjects&#x2019; heads at the opera house; and she could only rail at him or wring her hands when he made passes at every <i>signorina</i> in sight. Married to a buffoon, Maria Carolina became the decision maker at a crucial point in Neapolitan history, with Napoleon encroaching from all sides.</p><p>An overarching behavioral pattern emerges in many of the unions profiled here. Perhaps it was the fact that these royal couples couldn&#x2019;t easily extricate themselves from a bad marriage. Consequently, a parabola of matrimonial misery can be drawn, beginning with mutual indifference on the part of the spouses, who in most cases scarcely knew each other, but certainly hadn&#x2019;t viewed their mates with anything approaching passionate attachment. As the marriage progressed, familiarity did indeed breed contempt, if not utter loathing&#x2014;often fertile ground for adultery. However, by the end of some of the lengthier marriages, the sparring spouses had become as comfortable together as a pair of bedroom slippers, settling into a benign state of tolerance and acceptance, occasionally sharing a platonic friendship that was solidified by their mutual devotion to their children. By the time death took one of them from the other, the survivor was often surprised by the intensity of his or her grief: It was a poignant realization, but a little too late to do anything about it.</p><p>The remarkable real-life stories in <i>Inglorious Royal Marriages</i> are interconnected; among the heroes and heroines of these connubial catastrophes are some of Europe&#x2019;s most famous monarchs, as well as others whose lives may be less familiar to readers. Providing context and key events of their reigns, including Readeption, Reformation, restorations, and revolutions, this compendium of royal love gone wrong proves that once again, real life is often stranger&#x2014;and juicier&#x2014;than fiction!</p><p></p><p></p><p>It is said that history is written by the winners. Given the manner in which both sides of a conflict are often portrayed, this contention is unsurprising. For example, two of the fifteenth century&#x2019;s biggest losers were England&#x2019;s unpopular King Henry VI and his French-born wife, Margaret of Anjou. They were on the wrong side of fortune in what was then called the Cousins&#x2019; War&#x2014;a bloody, decades-long dispute that would eventually be known as the Wars of the Roses, after the red and white floral badges adopted by the feuding royal houses of Lancaster and York.</p><p>History has not been kind to either spouse. Even Henry&#x2019;s contemporary chroniclers drew biased portraits, based upon their own partisanship, fear of reprisals, or propaganda generated by years of civil war and multiple shifts in the political landscape, including regime changes.</p><p>Henry VI, who ascended the throne at the age of nine months, was the youngest English monarch to wear the crown, and the only one ever to be rightfully acknowledged and crowned as the king of <i>France</i> as well. Nonetheless, he is still perceived as one of the worst, and certainly among the weakest, sovereigns in English history. His reign was thirty-nine long years, and from the time he was a teen, he proved himself to be overly prudish and pious, credulous and malleable. He&#x2019;s remembered as a failure, the only English king to lose his crown twice, his sovereignty ending in civil war.</p><p>Yet where has posterity largely placed the blame for Henry&#x2019;s catalog of misjudgment and poor governance? On his <i>wife</i>, Margaret of Anjou, &#x201c;she-wolf of France.&#x201d;</p><p>This slur on Margaret&#x2019;s character has endured for more than four centuries, and it came from the quill of a dramatist. William Shakespeare&#x2019;s indelible portrayals of the key figures in the Wars of the Roses have forever shaped the way we view them, and although Shakespeare relied upon contemporary chronicles as a springboard for his history plays, scholars ever since have continued to promulgate his theatrical portrayal of Margaret as fact.</p><p>In <i>Henry VI, Part 3</i>, Act I, scene iv, line 110, Shakespeare places the words &#x201c;She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; into the mouth of Margaret&#x2019;s greatest enemy, Richard, Duke of York&#x2014;the father of the man who will one day depose her husband and seize his throne. The &#x201c;she-wolf&#x201d; insult, which is utterly in character for the duke, comes at the top of a lengthy diatribe jam-packed with insults against Margaret, blaming her for the death of his teenage son, the Earl of Rutland. Very dramatic in the play, but the real Margaret wasn&#x2019;t even present when Rutland was slain.</p><p>In Act V at line 80 in scene iv, York&#x2019;s insult will be paralleled when <i>Margaret</i> calls his son, Edward IV, usurper of her husband&#x2019;s crown, a &#x201c;wolf.&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve yet to come across another analysis of Margaret of Anjou that refers to the <i>other </i>booke...</p></p><h2>While Drowning in the Desert</h2><p>Edgar and Shamus Award-nominee Don Winslow combines breathless suspense, zany wit, and whiplash action in his latest novel featuring grad student/private eye Neal Carey. Now Neal's assigned to escort monkeyish octogenarian Natty Silver home from Las Vegas to Palm Springs. Natty, once a burlesque top banana, has a nonstop barrage of corny jokes, an eye for an aging cocktail waitress, and a chronic disappearing act.<br><br>When Neal catches up with him, he can see why Natty doesn't want to go home. Sole witness to a crime, he's now the quarry of hard-faced suits, a fascist con artist, and a career-track assassin. And bodyguard Neal-scorching through the trackless desert at 80 mph, brooding on his inner child by freezing starlight, and looking down the barrel of one gun too many-is soon dodging vultures and on the brink of a surprise watery grave.<br></p><p><b>Don Winslow </b>is the author of the Edgar-nominated <i>A Cool Breeze on the Underground, The Trail to Buddha's Mirror, Way Down on the High Lonely, While Drowning in the Desert, </i>and <i>The Death and Life of Bobby Z. </i>He lives in California.<br>In yet another slapstick mystery, Neal Carey (A Long Walk Up the Waterslide, 1995) is driving across the Nevada desert with the aging, legendary comedian Natty Silver yakking his vaudeville shtick nonstop. Neal is taking Natty home to California from Vegas, but a couple of no-goodniks are after Natty, and the old man won't say why. Chaperoning Natty is hard?he won't shut up, except when he tries to get away and get laid. The bad guys are Heinz, a German money-launderer, and his Lebanese sidekick, Sami, who's dumber than wood. Meanwhile, Neal's girl, Karen, is in a raging hurry for marriage and motherhood; and Hope White (billed as "The Great Hope White"), a Vegas performer no longer as young as she once was, is rekindling an old torch for Natty. The principal players take turns hogging the narrative, and soon everyone converges for the big dramatic showdown, with the damsels predictably imperiled by Heinz. Okay. Maybe it's not that dramatic. Winslow's style isn't flashy, and his notion of suspense is downright laughable. Yet he has a way with crisp dialogue (or, in Natty's case, monologue), and the laughs keep coming. Neal isn't a tough guy, but he's pretty lucky. Lucky enough to find water in the sand and ferry the irascible Natty, who claims to have taught a young Lou Costello "Who's on First," to safety. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Cabinet of Wonders: The Kronos Chronicles: Book I</h2><p><p><b>Marie Rutkoski's startling debut novel, the first book in the Kronos Chronicles, about the risks we take to protect those we love, brims with magic, political intrigue, and heroism. </b></p><p>Petra Kronos has a simple, happy life.

The Bohemian countryside on this August morning looked almost like a golden ocean with huge, swelling waves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A rickety cart was wending its way through a valley. Two men were perched atop the riding seat, watching the sturdy horse as it pulled them along. There was a bundle wrapped in cloth that took up most of the space in the open cart bed behind the men.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of them, Jarek, held the reins. He coughed. &#x201c;I should be paid extra for this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What a stench.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; said Martin, Jarek&#x2019;s companion. He turned around to look at the bundle.<br>Jarek saw him do it. &#x201c;No, not that. Those blasted brassica flowers. They stink fouler than a five-hundred-year-old outhouse.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh, that,&#x201d; Martin replied. &#x201c;They smell sweet to me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The yellowness of the hills was caused by thousands of flowers, clustered and thick.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jarek gagged. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t like to be one of you hill people, working the flower fields. My clothes are going to smell rotten by the time we get back to Prague.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too lazy to get offended, Martin leaned back in the cracked leather seat. &#x201c;Many folks enjoy the smell of brassica. It&#x2019;s just one of those things you love or hate. Like eating asparagus.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Raised with the stink as you were, I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re used to it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And remember&#x201d;&#x2014;Martin wagged a finger at him, pretending he had not heard Jarek&#x2019;s last comment&#x2014;&#x201c;Bohemia needs those flowers. Bet it&#x2019;ll be a good harvest this year. Soon the farmers will be out in the fields to collect the seeds and press them into oil. You can grumble like a goat about the scent, but that brassica&#x2019;s used for all sorts of things.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The horse took a turn in the dirt road and one of the cart wheels dipped into a large hole, jolting the cart.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bundle in the back groaned.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Here now!&#x201d; Martin craned his neck to scowl at the dark shape. &#x201c;None of that! You&#x2019;ll give us a bit of quiet.&#x201d; He made an impatient sound at the back of his throat. He took off his hat and fanned the sweat on his face. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s very hot,&#x201d; he said, and sighed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Jarek drawled, staring ahead.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Good money, though, this trip.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d; Jarek flapped the reins. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re almost there, anyway. Should take us about half an hour.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What, have you been here before? I thought you never left Prague. How do you know this area?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Jarek shifted in the seat. &#x201c;But the horse does.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin gave him an odd look. &#x201c;And she told you how long we&#x2019;ve got left, did she?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jarek laughed, possibly for the first time during the whole trip. &#x201c;Nah, course not! I was only joking.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it seemed like a strange sort of joke.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Do you know what he did?&#x201d; Jarek said, jerking his chin toward the bundle, whose breathing had gotten louder and ragged.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin was still looking at Jarek suspiciously. &#x201c;No. Didn&#x2019;t ask, and that&#x2019;s the honest truth.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jarek nodded. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s best that way.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The order,&#x201d; Martin said, &#x201c;came from the prince himself.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was news to Jarek. Learning this detail made him realize that he had been in a dark mood for the past several hours. Realizing this was like suddenly getting a cramp after sitting too long in one position. And, as a matter of fact, Jarek then thought, he did have a cramp in his lower back.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t tell me the orders came directly from the prince,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t ask.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which was true. Jarek did not ask any questions when Martin, who also took care of the prince&#x2019;s horses, proposed they make a delivery to the village of Okno (with some of the profit going to Jarek, of course). And Jarek did not ask any questions when two castle menservants met him and Martin in the stables, carrying a man who seemed barely conscious, and whose face was wrapped in a bloody bandage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ah, there we are,&#x201d; Martin said, pointing his hand at a nest of buildings. The houses and shops began to distinguish themselves, and the dirt path became the main cobblestone road that ran straight through Okno.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The village looked prosperous. There were several stone houses. The wooden ones were in solid condition, often with pretty patterns of different-colored strips of wood decorating the window frames, many of which had real glass set into them. Shop signs advertised goods: leather tack for horses, books, carpentry, glassworks, and cloth. Women walked by in full, unstained skirts. Even a passing stray dog seemed rather fat for an independent creature. The road turned into a small square whose center was marked by a fountain that was well designed, its water bubbling over three tiers of stone.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin dug a parchment out of his jerkin pocket and consulted it. &#x201c;Turn left here.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t make any sense,&#x201d; Jarek mused.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I am the one with the map, and you should turn left.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No, I mean this&#x201d;&#x2014;he tilted his head toward the back of the cart&#x2014;&#x201c;doesn&#x2019;t make any sense. What could he have done to deserve that kind of punishment, and get sent home instead of being clapped into the nearest jail cell?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Dunno.&#x201d; Martin waved his hand airily, chasing away a fly. &#x201c;Maybe he killed someone.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Then he would be in prison or executed or both.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Maybe he killed the prince&#x2019;s favorite dog.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Then he would be in prison or executed or both.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin laughed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;All I&#x2019;m saying is this,&#x201d; Jarek continued, &#x201c;if you want to get rid of a weed, you don&#x2019;t just clip some of its stems and call it a day.&#x201d; The road they turned down had fewer houses. Ribbons of wind passed between the buildings and through the men&#x2019;s sweaty hair. &#x201c;The weed&#x2019;ll grow back. There&#x2019;s always the chance for revenge.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Him?&#x201d; Martin laughed again. &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m glad I picked you to drive. You&#x2019;re a funny sort, you are. Weed or no, this fellow&#x2019;s in no shape for action. Hold on now&#x2014;&#x201d; Martin looked at the map again and glanced at a tall, skinny stone house set far apart from the others. As they drew closer, they saw that the ground floor was a shop, its windows crowded with bizarre metal objects, clocks, and tin toys bouncing like grasshoppers. Jarek could not read the words painted over the door, but a sign hanging from the corner of the house showed a many-pointed compass. &#x201c;Stop here,&#x201d; Martin said. &#x201c;This is it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jarek pulled on the reins. His hands settled in his lap, but they still gripped the leather straps. &#x201c;He may have sons. Angry ones.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin thumped Jarek on the shoulder. &#x201c;No fear, my friend,&#x201d; he said, and pointed toward the door, which had opened. In the doorway stood a girl, tall for her age, which was twelve. Underneath a long tangle of brown hair her face was wary. She was dressed in a nightgown, but stood defiantly, as if to say that she knew that wasn&#x2019;t normal but didn&#x2019;t care. She stared straight at them. Her eyes were narrowed&#x2014;but perhaps, Jarek thought, this was because of the sun and not because she already hated them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin leaned to whisper in Jarek&#x2019;s ear. &#x201c;As I said, don&#x2019;t worry. He&#x2019;s only got her.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed to Jarek that his backache had gotten worse.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mare sighed. Then she spoke silently in his mind the way she did with no other human, for she knew none who had Jarek&#x2019;s gift to understand her. If you were a horse, she told him, you would be used to bearing such unpleasant burdens.<br>Excerpted from THE CABINET OF WONDERS by Marie Rutkoski.<br>Copyright � 2008 by Marie Rutkoski.<br>Published in 2010 Square Fish.<br>All rights reserved.

Time is treated as a language, organizer, and message system revealing people&#39;s feelings about each other and reflecting differences between cultures.Edward T. Hall was a widely traveled anthropologist whose fieldwork took him all over the world&#x2014;from the Pueblo cultures of the American Southwest to Europe and the Middle East. As director of the State Department&#x2019;s Point Four Training Program in the 1950s, Dr. Hall&#x2019;s mission was to teach foreign-bound technicians and administrators how to communicate effectively across cultural boundaries. He was a consultant to architects on human factors in design and to business and government agencies in the field of intercultural relations, and had taught at the University of Denver, Bennington College, the Washington School of Psychiatry, the Harvard Business School, the Illinois Institute of Technology, and Northwestern University. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Hall was born in Webster Groves, Missouri.

In this simple book, she uses her own experiences to show how life&#39;s hardships can be relanguaged and re-visioned to become lessons that teach us as we grow, heal, and learn to love. Iyanla Vanzant is an example of how yesterday&#39;s tears become the seeds of today&#39;s hope, renewal, and strength.</p><p><i>"Life is about cleaning up the crap and, while you're doing it, being okay with the fact that you have to do it.... A word of caution. You can't get caught up in the crap! If you do, you will surely lose sight of the real meaning of life and lose your Self."</i><p> Iyanla Vanzant knows plenty about dealing with just such "crap." She has led a difficult life, full of periods of abuse and self-loathing, but she has managed to learn "the lessons beneath the tears" and move beyond her grief and into understanding. In <i>Yesterday, I Cried</i>, she passes these lessons along, continually stressing that past hardships can and should be used to teach us how to grow, heal, and love others and ourselves. The message is one that has been echoed in her bestsellers <i>One Day My Soul Just Opened Up</i> and <i>In the Meantime</i>, but when presented as a memoir, the result is particularly moving.</p><p> As any regular <i>Oprah</i> viewer knows, Vanzant is a feisty and charismatic orator, and her no-nonsense style translates well into print. She is candid about her experiences without ever painting herself as a victim, effectively coming across as inspirational rather than preachy or self-pitying. The tone of the book is especially engaging because she seems to be actively working out her problems as she writes, gently pulling the reader into what becomes a mutual catharsis. "Of all things to master," she asks, "why did I have to pick tears?" By the end of <i>Yesterday, I Cried</i>, she finds the answer. And in searching the depths of her own soul, she encourages others to do the same.</p>Rev. Dr. Iyanla Vanzant, author and internationally renowned speaker, is best known for her riveting work as the host of <i>Iyanla Fix My Life</i> on the OWN (Oprah Winfrey Network). Oprah herself has called Iyanla, <i>&#x201c;the most powerful spiritual healer, fixer, teacher, on the planet.&#x201d;</i>&nbsp; Oprah Winfrey has publicly acknowledged that Fix My Life and Iyanla was the turning point for the fledgling Oprah Winfrey Network. Susan Taylor, former editor-in-chief of <i>Essence</i> magazine calls her, <i>&#x201c;The real deal,&#x201d;</i> in the arena of personal healing and spiritual growth.&#x201d;&nbsp; Elizabeth Gilbert, author of <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i> says, <i>&#x201c;Iyanla is a walking, talking, miracle in heels, who carries the energy to heal the masses.&#x201d; </i>Many of the 2.8 million people who follow her on Facebook lovingly call her, <i>&#x201c;auntie,&#x201d;</i> yet if you ask Iyanla she would say, &#x201c;<i>I am just an ordinary person committed to doing extraordinary things as a demonstration of what is possible when you love God, have faith in yourself, and trust the amazing process called life.&#x201d;</i><br> <br>As the Founder and Executive Director of the Inner Visions Institute for Spiritual Development, Iyanla conducts workshops and classes around the country, throughout Africa and the UK. Sharing her brand of practical spiritual wisdom, a blend of ancient African wisdom and universal principles, Iyanla has touched the minds and heart of more than 8 million readers in 23 languages. Her latest venture, the creation of MasterPeace Body Therapy, a line of natural body care products has received rave reviews on HSN.<br> <br>Cooking and making scrapbooks are her guilty pleasures. Studying the Bible and other sacred texts is the foundation of her life. Iyanla cherishes her collection of over 100 Bibles in various translations. Watching re-runs of <i>Law and Order </i>is her joy. Spending time with her grandchildren and doing her own laundry is what keeps her grounded. Knowing that she is on purpose; loving what she does; doing everything with excellence; is what Iyanla Vanzant says makes her the woman that she is today.</p><h2>The House That Jack Built: My Life As a Trailblazer in Broadcasting and Entertainment</h2><p><p><em>The House That Jack Built</em> is the life story of Hal Jackson, one of the most important figures in American radio and television. When starting out as a young professional, during the Jim Crow era in Washington, D.C., Jackson was told by the management of WINX that no Black man would ever broadcast at their station. He ultimately proved them wrong and was given a time slot of the station -- thus beginning a long and illustrious career, filled with an extraordinary series of firsts:</p><ul><li>The first Black radio announcer on network radio.</li><li>The first Black inducted in the Radio Hall of Fame. </li><li>The first Black host of a jazz show on the ABC network.</li><li>The first Black to do play-by-play sports announcing on radio.</li><li>The first Black to host an interracial network show on NBC-TV.</li><li>The first person to broadcast from a theater live.</li><li>He organized and was one of the owners of the first Black team to win the World's Basketball Championship.</li><li>The first Black host of an international network television presentation.</li><li>He was instrumental in acquiring the first radio station owned and operated by Blacks in New York City.</li><li>At a time when Block women were prohibited from entering beauty pageants, he founded Hal Jackson's Talented Teen International contest.</li></ul><p>Here is a remarkable story about a remarkable person. <em>The House That Jack Built</em> is an important addition to the history of media in the United States.</p></p><p>Hal Jackson has been on the radio since the late 1930s and is host and executive producer of <em>Sunday Classics,</em> heard on New York's 107.5, WBLS. He is Group Chairman of Inner City Broadcasting and Executive Producer and Host of his Talented Teens International competition. He lives in New York City with his wife, Debra.<br><br>James Haskins is the author of more than a hundred books for both adults and children, including <em>The Cotton Club,</em> which inspired the motion picture of the same name, and <em>The Story of Stevie Wonder,</em> which won the Coretta Scott King Award. He was honored with the <em>Washington Post</em>/Children's Book Guild Award for his body of work, and his books <em>Black Music in America,</em> and <em>The March on Washington</em> both won the Carter G. Woodson Award. Mr. Haskins passed away in 2005.<p> </p>In His Own Words...<p></p><p>"I was born in Dentopolis, Alabama and spent my childhood in a household with lots of children, a household where I felt a great need for privacy. One of the places I found privacy was in books. I could be anywhere at all, but if I was reading it book I was by in myself. Sometimes it was hard for me to get books. In the 1950s, when I was a child, the South was rigidly segregated. The Demopolis Public library was for whites; I black child could not go there. My mother arranged for a white friend to get books from the library for me. Many years later, I returned to Demopolis and gave some of the books I had written to the library I could never enter as a child. Some Years after that, I was invited to give an important speech it that same library.</p><p>"I attended high school in Boston, Massachuetts, and college in a variety of places, the first of which was Alabama State University in Montgomery. It Was the time of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which began after a black woman named osa Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a city bus to a white man. Inspired by her action and led by a young minister Martin Luther King, Jr., black people boycotted the buses for more than a year until the United States Supreme Court ruled that segregation on public buses was unconstitutional. I helped hand out leaflets urging black people to stay off the buses and Was expelled front the college for doing so. Georgetown University In Washington, D.C., then offered me a scholarship, and I enrolled there.</p><p>"After graduating from college, I moved to New York, where I sold newspaper advertising space and worked as a stock trader on Wall Street before I decided to become a teacher. I taught music and special education classes in Harlem; My first book, <em>Diary Of a Schoolteacher,</em> was a result of my experiences.</p><p>"It was the 1960s, and college and high school Students were demonstrating against the war in Vietnam and for the civil rights of black people. My students were aware of those events and wanted to know more about them. But there were no books written on their level. So I started writing books for young people about the various movements--antiwar, civil rights, black power. After that I began writing biographies of black people, because young people black and white--like to read about how successful people grew up and overcame the barriers of poverty and racial discrinination.</p><p>"Since the early 1970s, I have taught on the collage level, and I have continued to write books. I have published more than 125 on many subjects for children, young adults, and adults. In 1994, the <em>Washington Post</em> Children's Book Guild honored me for my body of work in nonfiction for children.</p><p>"I have learned a lot from writing books. I have also met many important people, including Mrs. Rosa Parks herself, because I helped her write her autobiographies for young adults, <em>Rosa Park: My Story</em>; and for children, <em>I Am Rosa Parks</em>. When I think about that, I am amazed that the woman who was so important to my experiences as a young college student--not to mention the whole civil rights movement--now my friend.</p><p>"Books were once--and still are--a way to find my own private world. But they have also introduced me to a world far larger than I would otherwise have experienced. I love books, and I feel very fortunate to have been able to share this love With so many People."</p>Written by a smooth-voiced disk jockey who remains a major force in the business he helped create, this fascinating memoir encompasses six decades of black radio in America. Ably assisted by veteran writer Haskins (Rosa Parks; Spike Lee, etc.), Jackson recalls his roots in close-knit Charleston, S.C., where his loving family was highly respected. The sudden deaths of both of his parents within a period of a few months sent Jackson into a tailspin at age eight, resulting in a series of moves and a period of homelessness. Music entered his life through rambunctious church services, while his love for the airwaves began with his purchase of an old Emerson radio receiver. Determined, ambitious and focused, he wasn't stopped by biting racial slurs or other obstacles in his path. His first radio show, The Bronze Review, became a hit in 1939 with its mix of music and guests. Jackson's fans will delight in his remembrances of many show-business personalities, as he pushed ahead in a record-setting career: first African-American disc jockey, first African-American play-by-play sports announcer and first African-American founder of a black basketball league. By 1949, he had tackled the new television market with a revamped version of his radio show. Jackson shows no bitterness when he discusses his part in the first radio payola scandal, an ordeal that left him jobless and broke, facing charges that resulted in his arrest and later acquittal. The sense of exhilaration and pride in the last chapters comes from his final set of victories: becoming the first African-American to buy a radio station and staging a solid comeback that earned him induction into the Broadcast Hall of Fame and the Radio Hall of Fame. While this gracious and inspiring memoir does not reveal much about the inner man, it evokes the joy of achievements made with grit, spunk and sheer willpower.

Covers 1957 to 1961, the period when Saarinen was working on iconic projects like Dulles International Airpot Terminal, the former TWA Terminal at Kennedy Airport and the St. Louis Arch. Richard Knight, Saarinen&#39;s &#34;house photographer&#34;, documents in black and white photographs and a personal memoir the excitement of being part of this unparalleled creative team. Timed to coincide with a touring Saarinen retrospective (beginning at the Cranbrook Institute in fall 2007 and traveling to Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Minneapolis, St. Louis, New York, and New Haven), the book includes a foreward on Saarinen&#39;s artistic vision and office culture by Cesar Pelli, who began his career in the architect&#39;s office, and an afterword by architectural historian Pierluigi Serraino on the significance of large-scale model-making in Saarinen&#39;s work.</p><p></p><h2>Puzzled Heart (Kate Fansler Novels)</h2><p>"Eminently readable and satisfying," said P. D. James about Amanda Cross's acclaimed New York mysteries featuring English professor Kate Fansler. <br><br>Those accolades apply equally to The Puzzled Heart, in which Kate Fansler's husband Reed is kidnapped--and will be killed unless Kate obeys the carefully delineated directives of a ransom note.<br><br>Tormented by her own puzzled heart, Kate seeks solace and wise counsel from both old friends and new. But who precisely is the enemy? Is he or she a vengeful colleague? A hostile student? A terrorist sect? The questions mount as Kate searches for Reed--accompanied by her trusty new companion, a Saint Bernard puppy named Bancroft.<br><br>Hovering near Kate and Bancroft, almost within touch, are rampant cruelties and calculated menace. The madness of our time is on the move. And the moment is ripe for murder. . . .<br><br>The elegant crime novels of Amanda Cross have thrilled a generation of readers. The Puzzled Heart reconfirms her standing as the reigning master of the literary mystery.</p><p>Feminist scholar (and senior citizen) Carolyn Heilbrun has been writing and lecturing for years about the unique freedom women gain from being old and thus "invisible" in our culture. Writing under the name of Amanda Cross, she continues to explore this theme in another of her popular academic mysteries featuring feminist professor Kate Fansler. In <i>The Puzzled Heart</i>, Fansler's husband, Reed, has been kidnapped, and the ransom demand requires Kate to give up her left-leaning politics and join the Christian Right. Instead, Kate turns to septuagenarian detective Harriet Furst, a woman whose advanced age allows her to "move about the world unseen" as she gathers clues. It doesn't take long for Harriet to find Reed, but discovering who was behind the kidnapping proves more difficult. In the course of exposing the culprit, Cross entertains her audience with the kind of highly literate, witty writing and outspoken politics that have been hallmarks of Kate Fansler mysteries for the past 30 years.When I read THE JAMES JOYCE MURDER, I instantly became a fan of Amanda Cross and her protagonist, English professor Kate Fansler. And I continued to devour this wonderful series: THE QUESTION OF MAX, DEATH IN A TENURED POSITION, NO WORD FROM WINIFRED -- and onward. In time, I (and many other readers) came to realize that "Amanda Cross" is a pseudonym for Dr. Carolyn G. Heilbrun, the revered Columbia University professor whose WRITING A WOMAN'S LIFE and other nonfiction volumes are recognized as ground-breaking classics in literary criticism and feminist studies. My admiration for the author grew and grew -- in both her guises. And then a few years ago, I had the great good fortune to become the editor of her "Amanda Cross" half. Which has given me many opportunities to get to know Carolyn personally (it helps that we live only a few blocks from each other). So I've been in the company of this widely beloved author for autograph parties, bookstore events, an honorary dinner, and recently at the ALA (American Library Association) conference, where scores of adoring fans -- librarians and educators -- patiently queued up to get personally autographed copies of THE PUZZLED HEART, the latest Fansler mystery, as well as backlist titles in the series. Even with the resultant writer's cramp, it was a great day for "Amanda." And another cherished memory I have of this charming, gracious, and multitalented author.<br><br>--Joe Blades, Associate Publisher</p><h2>The Sunset Gates</h2><p>Heart must find her family and a safe haven for the unicorns. A drawing in the book from Dunraven&#39;s castle shows the same unicorn design as her foundling blanket! Perhaps the book tells more about her family -- but she cannot read it. Searching for a teacher, she finds a blacksmith whose family forge was made by unicorn magic. His old records show that his grandfather made giant iron gates using the same design. If Heart can find those gates perhaps she will find her family -- but will Dunraven&#39;s men find her first?</p><p>Kathleen Duey&#x2019;s works include the middle grade American Diaries and Survivors series, as well as the well-reviewed chapter book series The Unicorn&#x2019;s Secret and its companion series, The Faeries&#x2019; Promise. She is also the National Book Award&#x2013;nominated author of <i>Skin Hunger</i>. She lives in Fallbrook, California.Reviewed with Kathleen Duey's <i>True Heart</i>.<p>Gr. 2-4. Books in the early-chapter-book Unicorn's Secret series tell the story of Heart Avamir, who ran away from her caregiver in order to protect a unicorn mare and her colt. Along the way she has made friends with a group of gypsies, and in <i>Sunset Gates</i>, the fifth book, she accompanies them while trying to learn more about her own life. She knows that some information she needs is in a book, but learning to read while on the road is practically impossible. She eventually gets assistance from an old enemy turned friend, who not only teaches her to read but also helps her travel to the mountain where she thinks answers may lie. In <i>True Heart</i>, the sixth book of a projected eight, Heart attempts to reunite with the gypsies, but it's difficult to keep the unicorns safe as she travels to a festival where the gypsies are to appear. By the end, though, Heart has made friends with a young lord and acquired a bit more reading skill and another book. Duey continues to write in short, simple sentences while telling a story with texture and excitement, and it's a nice twist for children struggling with reading to find a heroine sharing their difficulties. <i>Susan Dove Lempke</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

If you sat down right now to watch every hour of the TV shows and movies that Aaron Spelling has produced, it would be a full 125 days later before you were finished. This is assuming, of course, that the human mind could safely survive such an extended dose of Spelling's wares: the endless parade of beautiful vixens and roguish millionaires, hipster PIs and ripe teenyboppers, pervasive pap and ubiquitous fluff. To his credit, Spelling is a modest man. He makes few grand claims for his oeuvre beyond that of entertainment (with an occasional gesture toward social consciousness). As you might expect from his shows, his own story goes from rags to riches. Fleeing pogroms, his parents ended up in Dallas, where the young Spelling struggled with anti-Semitic bullying and the shame of poverty. Books and movies were his only friends, and like many poor Jews of his generation, he believed that the entertainment industry offered a front-row ticket to success. Acting led to directing, which led to writing, then finally to producing. It was here that Spelling found his forte as he, along with various partners, produced an almost uninterrupted string of long-running hits. (It doesn't take a Freudian to realize that pervasive themes of many of these shows--wish-fulfillment, escapism, social acceptance--have strong autobiographical connections.) While Spelling (with USA Today TV reporter Graham) tells a lot of great showbiz stories, he dishes little dirt. In fact, he has almost nothing unkind to say about anyone. Problem actors, double-dealing executives, obstreperous writers--all are treated with a rare tact and courtliness. Perhaps, sometimes, nice guys don't finish last. Professionally done, with many enjoyable moments, but not quite an Emmy-winning performance. (16 pages b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>For a man who's tapped into the world's TV-viewing habits like no one else, mega-producer Spelling comes across as a surprisingly ordinary fellow in his autobiography. He makes producing "a smash hit a decade"?The Mod Squad, Dynasty and Melrose Place among them?look like happy and very lucrative accidents. The son of poor Eastern European Jews who settled in Dallas, Spelling grew up spinning yarns to fight redneck taunts, honing story skills that eventually led him through the early days of TV production and, in time, to realize his own Fantasy Island (another Spelling production) lifestyle. He portrays himself here with down-home graciousness?even if he jokes that he can't find his bedroom in his palatial mansion. He respectfully spares us the TV-star gossip and gives close friends and family members, like his loving wife, Candy, paragraphs for their own celebrity roast anecdotes. Such passages come off as padding, however, as do the lengthy excerpts from produced scripts Spelling wrote early in his career. If Spelling's writing works on the tube, it doesn't fly on the printed page. This tame memoir offers little in the way of character shading or social insight. The author answers critics who called Charlie's Angels "jiggle" with: "Haven't reporters ever been to the beach before?" Spelling has enjoyed a prime-time life, but his memoir is anything but.

With an unstoppable combination of charm and ever-more-effective communication skills, she rose steadily from ad-agency secretary to sought-after copywriter to bestselling author and Editor-in-Chief of <em>Cosmopolitan </em>-- the world's largest-circulation young women's magazine. Every aspect of her career has had to do with communicating by words.In her decades as a publishing superstar, she has assigned and edited thousands of pieces by writers of all kinds, from seasoned professionals who needed just a little help with polishing their words to talented beginners with a good idea but not much experience. She gave them all the same straightforward advice -- and now she shares it with everyone who wants to write clear, effective, colorful, <em>memorable</em> prose.</p><p>Despite her meteoric rise from office secretary to longtime editor-in-chief of <i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine, Helen Gurley Brown is an odd fit as an author of a book about writing. <i>The Writer's Rules</i> is full of dot-dot-dots and blah, blah, blahs, exclamation points and emphatic italics. "How early can you <i>be</i> in love with written words?" Brown asks in the book's introduction. "Early, of course, but for me it wasn't what other people wrote that intrigued me but what I wrote myself ... baby ego!" Brown's effusive writing seems best suited to the sex-and-the-single-girl prose of <i>Cosmopolitan</i> or to personal correspondence (which makes sense: the author has been an avid letter writer, she says, since the age of 6). The 50 simple rules around which the book is organized are part <i>Cosmo</i> guidelines and part Strunk and White. They range from reminders to "write the way you talk" and "stick to one tense" to an appeal not to be "relentlessly depressing." <p> The best chapter in this book, and the one clearly closest to the author's heart, is the one on letter writing. Here, Brown divulges her secrets to writing thank-you notes, effective complaint letters (be reasonable and slip in a touch of flattery), job-application letters, fan mail, condolence letters, and even love letters. Brown herself writes dozens of letters a week. The late composer Burton Lane, we are told, "smiled all day" after receiving a note from her. And while Woody Allen sent along a bottle of 1990 Ch�teau Lafitte-Rothschild with his note of thanks for a dinner party she threw for him and Soon-Yi, Elizabeth Taylor didn't write "boo" when Brown sent her an antique brooch. <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>Helen Gurley Brown is the legendary, longtime editor of <em>Cosmopolitan,<em> as well as the author of numerous bestsellers, starting with <em>Sex and the Single Girl<em>.

Henry Morton Stanley&#39;s greeting to the Scottish medical missionary David Livingstone...&#39;Dr Livingstone, I presume?&#39; is to exploration what Holmes&#39;s Elementary, my dear Watson is to detective fiction. It took place in a remote African settlement when a travelling correspondent for the New York Herald successfully concluded an assignment to find the renowned explorer. But the meeting, and the events surrounding it, proved to be more than just a simple news story. Stanley s accounts of his expedition not only helped transform Livingstone into one of the great Victorian heroes, but were also the springboard from which Stanley himself became the most accomplished of all African explorers. How I Found Livingstone was written in six weeks, published in November 1872, and had sold through three printings by Christmas. For Stanley was not only a great explorer, he was also one of the most talented writers ever to tell the tale of travel and discovery in Africa. His account of his journey through East Africa, and his time spent investigating Lake Tanganyika with Livingstone, is one of the classics of African exploration.</p><p>HENRY M. STANLEY was a Welsh journalist and explorer. After doing freelance journalism, he joined the <i>New York Herald</i> and in 1868 accompanied an expedition to Abyssinia. He also visited Egypt, Palestine, Turkey, Persia, and India. He is most famous for his exploration of Africa and his search for David Livingstone, whom he met in Tanganyika.</p><h2>Extra-Titanic</h2><p>April 14, 1912, a day of infamy! Just before midnight, the cold waters of the North Atlantic were parted by the magnificent new luxury liner SS Titanic. Suddenly, a scraping sound, a jarring sensation, and the mighty liner began to sink. Within hours it had plummeted into the depths of the ocean with a loss of 1,595 of her 2,340 passengers. In this graphic and thrilling collection of vintage newspaper pages--the true story of the Titanic&#39;s demise and the tales of her survivors are told with the immediacy that only the newspapers of the time were able to capture. Not only was this the maiden voyage of a great ship, it was the social event of the decade. The cream of society of two continents was aboard. They perished along with sailors, women, children, and impoverished steerage passengers. Full speed ahead had wrought death and devastation. With this one horrible event, man&#39;s faith in his ability to harness technology to beat the elements of nature came crumbling down. No longer would captains plow through the night at full-speed in iceberg-filled waters. No longer would we believe we could conquer the unconquerable. Here you will find the heart-rending personal stories of the survivors, as well as accounts of the launch of the Titanic, the problems of early wireless telegraphy, the terror of icebergs, and the vanity and arrogance of the owners and captain that led to the greatest seafaring disaster of all time.</p><p>Eric C. Caren and Stephen A. Goldman (both consultants to the recently-opened Newseum in Arlington, Virginia), provided the original newspapers for this book from their collections, which are considered to be the most extensive in private hands. They recently formed OldNews, Inc., a company with archives of hundreds of thousands of old newspapers, peiodicals and pamphlets dating back to the 1500s.

But when he and his top team are ambushed by a rival, he is gravely injured and placed in &#x201c;half-life,&#x201d; a dreamlike state of suspended animation. Soon, though, the surviving members of the team begin experiencing some strange phenomena, such as Runciter&#x2019;s face appearing on coins and the world seeming to move backward in time. As consumables deteriorate and technology gets ever more primitive, the group needs to find out what is causing the shifts and what a mysterious product called Ubik has to do with it all.<br><br> &#x201c;More brilliant than similar experiments conducted by Pynchon or DeLillo.&#x201d;� Roberto Bolaño</p><p>Nobody but Philip K. Dick could so successfully combine SF comedy with the unease of reality gone wrong, shifting underfoot like quicksand. Besides grisly ideas like funeral parlors where you swap gossip for the advice of the frozen dead, <i>Ubik</i> (1969) offers such deadpan farce as a moneyless character's attack on the robot apartment door that demands a five-cent toll:<p> </p><blockquote>"I'll sue you," the door said as the first screw fell out.<p> Joe Chip said, "I've never been sued by a door. But I guess I can live through it."</p></blockquote><p> Chip works for Glen Runciter's anti-psi security agency, which hires out its talents to block telepathic snooping and paranormal dirty tricks. When its special team tackles a big job on the Moon, something goes terribly wrong. Runciter is killed, it seems--but messages from him now appear on toilet walls, traffic tickets, or product labels. Meanwhile, fragments of reality are timeslipping into past versions: Joe Chip's beloved stereo system reverts to a hand-cranked 78 player with bamboo needles. Why does Runciter's face appear on U.S. coins? Why the repeated ads for a hard-to-find universal panacea called Ubik ("safe when taken as directed")?</p><p> The true, chilling state of affairs slowly becomes clear, though the villain isn't who Joe Chip thinks. And this is Dick country, where final truths are never quite final and--with the help of Ubik--the reality/illusion balance can still be tilted the other way. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Philip K. Dick&#39;s searing metaphysical comedy of death and salvation is a tour de force of panoramic menace and unfettered slapstick, in which the departed give business advice, shop for their next incarnation, and run the continual risk of dying yet again.</p><h2>The Kingdom Fungi: The Biology of Mushrooms, Molds, and Lichens</h2><p>The ubiquitous fungi are little known and vastly underappreciated. Yet, without them we wouldn&#x2019;t have bread, alcohol, cheese, tofu, or the unique flavors of mushrooms, morels, and truffles. We can&#x2019;t survive without fungi. <br><br><i>The Kingdom Fungi</i> provides a comprehensive look at the biology, structure, and morphological diversity of these necessary organisms. It sheds light on their ecologically important roles in nature, their fascinating relationships with people, plants, and animals, and their practical applications in the manufacture of food, beverages, and pharmaceuticals. The book includes information about &#x201c;true&#x201d; fungi, fungus-like creatures (slime molds and water molds), and a group of &#x201c;composite&#x201d; organisms (lichens) that are more than just fungi. Particular attention is given to examples of fungi that might be found in the home and encountered in nature. <br><br><i>The Kingdom Fungi </i>is a useful introductory text for naturalists, mycologists, and anyone who wants to become more familiar with, and more appreciative of, the fascinating world of fungi. <br></p><p>Steven L.

Formerly an advertising executive for J. W. Thompson in the early 1990s, Patterson came up with the slogan &#34;Toys R Us Kid&#34;. Shortly after his success with Along Came A Spider he retired from the firm and devoted his time to writing. The novels featuring his character, Alex Cross, a black forensic psychologist formerly of the Washington, D.C. Police Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation, now working as a private psychologist and government consultant, are the most popular books among Patterson readers. James Patterson has been criticized by Stephen King, who called Patterson&#39;s books &#34;dopey thrillers&#34;.[citation needed] Patterson shrugged off the comments, stating that he wants to be the &#34;thrillingest thriller writer of all time&#34;.[citation needed] James Patterson has also been put as one of Forbes magazine&#39;s top 100 celebrities.Sexy, action-packed, with danger around every corner, this book engages listeners from the first moment. Billy Campbell heightens the tension with his pacing as he easily takes on the persona of Ned Kelly, lifeguard, thief, and ultimately, avenger. Told from the Ned's point of view, this story has it all: murder, mystery, art theft, romance, police chases, FBI agents, all among the wealthy community of Palm Beach. Campbell makes the listener feel Ned's emotions as the thief becomes a hero and then tries to impress the girl. Music, along with the occasional sound effects, such as gunshots and motorcycle chases, add to the fun and intrigue.

Wild and domesticated animals were also a part of these extravagant shows, and the elaborate presentation&#x2014;or sometimes butchery&#x2014;of creatures to gild an official's magnificence was among the most common forms of public diversion. Pitting bulls against bears, lions against Christians and criminals, elephants against rhinoceroses or parading large numbers of giraffe or zebras, the games devised by the Romans ranged from astonishing to brutally cruel. It is now difficult to comprehend the pleasure that huge crowds took from the death or struggle of animals and people, but the history of the role of animals in ancient Rome is both fascinating and important in view of modern sports spectacles and the enjoyment we take in animals in our daily lives.</p><p>Based entirely on primary source material and infused with the author's direct experience with many of the animals discussed, <i>Animals for Show and Pleasure in Ancient Rome</i> is a comprehensive investigation of the rise, function, and pageantry of wild and domesticated animals as household pets and as fodder for entertainment in the Roman world. Extending from Egypt through the Greek city-states to the magnificent coliseums of the golden age of Roman civilization, Jennison provides an absorbing, evocative, and in-depth history that includes information about what animals were known to the Romans, which creatures they liked best, which animals were used as pets, from what places they obtained animals and how much they cost, how they were trapped, and the architectural development and dispersion of arenas throughout the Roman world.

Many records, like the early twentieth-century census returns and school registers, will be familiar to researchers, but others are often overlooked by all but the most experienced of genealogists. An easy-to-use, informative guide to the comprehensive collections available at the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland is a key feature of Ian Maxwell&#x2019;s handbook. He also takes the reader through the records held in many libraries, museums and heritage centers across the province, and he provides detailed coverage of records that are available online. Unlike the rest of the British Isles, which has very extensive civil and census records, Irish ancestral research is hampered by the destruction of many of the major collections. Yet Ian Maxwell shows how family historians can make good use of church records, school registers and land and valuation records to trace their roots to the beginning of the nineteenth century and beyond.</p><p>Dr Ian Maxwell, a former record officer at the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, is now a freelance writer and a leading expert on Irish genealogy. He conducts courses on genealogy throughout Northern Ireland and he is a regular speaker at genealogical conferences in Belfast and Dublin. He writes articles regularly for Family History Monthly, Your Family Tree and Ancestor magazines on Irish, Scottish and English social history and genealogy. His previous publications include, Researching Armagh Ancestors, Researching Down Ancestors, Your Irish Ancestors and Tracing Your Scottish Ancestors.&#x201c;a well written book that is easy to recommend&#x201d; (<i>FGS FORUM, Fall 2011</i>)</p><h2>Crossriggs</h2><p>This historic book may have numerous typos and missing text.

CHAPTER XXVI Van Cassilis kept a sailing-boat in the harbour of one of the little red villages down on the shore, and he would go in it sometimes for whole days at a time, returning very sunburnt and cheerful. It had been an old promise that Matilda&#39;s boys were to be allowed to sail to the island with him, so they were greatly delighted when he appeared one morning asking if they might go the next day. Matilda could not bear to disappoint the children, and gave her consent. &#34;You&#39;ll come too, won&#39;t you, Sandy?&#34; Van inquired, looking at Alex. &#34;Oh, I will come if you like. I don&#39;t read on Saturdays, you know.&#34; &#34;Then perhaps I had better stay at home,&#34; said Matilda, but Alex turned to her eagerly--&#34;No, no, you must come--please, Matilda--if it&#39;s a day like this, the worst sailor in the world would enjoy it--you must come!&#34; Matilda agreed, although the prospect of a whole day&#39;s sailing was by no means such a pleasure to her as it was to Alex, who loved the sea and all that belonged to it. Old Hopeful and Alex were at one in this, and in former days, they had more than once gone to London by sea, for even the smallest voyage in the grubbiest vessel was a pleasure to both of them. Van&#39;s face brightened in an almost ludicrous way when he heard that Alex was coming. The children were in great delight. Sally was going elsewhere, and Baby was too young, so only the two older boys and Mike were allowed to go. The warmth had now come very suddenly. After a cold and dreary month of April came a week of heavenly weather; the sleeping orchards bloomed, the grass took on a livelier hue, the fresh wind came bounding across the fields with a gust of joy, and all the vexations of the changeful season were forgotten. Alex awoke this Saturday morning with the sense that the da...</p><p></p><h2>Exploring the Big Bend Country</h2><p><p>Photographer-naturalist Peter Koch first visited the new Big Bend National Park in February, 1945, on assignment to take promotional pictures for the National Park Service. He planned to spend a couple of weeks&#x2014;and ended up staying for the rest of his life. Koch's magnificent photographs and documentary film-lectures Big Bend, Life in a Desert Wilderness and Desert Gold introduced the park to people across the United States, drawing thousands of visitors to the Big Bend. His photographs and films of the region remain among the best ever produced, and are an invaluable visual record of the first four decades of Big Bend National Park.</p> <p>In this highly readable book, Koch's daughter June Cooper Price draws on the newspaper columns her father wrote for the Alpine Avalanche, supplemented by his photographs, journal entries, and short pieces by other family members, to present Peter Koch's vision of the Big Bend. The book opens with his first "big adventure," a six-day photographic trip through Santa Elena Canyon on a raft made from agave flower stalks. From there, Koch takes readers hiking on mountain trails and driving the scenic loop around Fort Davis. He also describes "wax smuggling" and other ways of making a living on the Mexican border; ranching in the Big Bend; the prehistory and Native Americans of the region; collaborating with botanist Barton Warnock on books of Trans-Pecos wildflowers; and the history and beauty of Presidio County, the Rio Grande, and the Chihuahuan Desert.</p> <p>This fascinating blend of firsthand adventures, natural history, and personal musings on anthropology and history creates an unforgettable portrait of both Peter Koch and the Big Bend region he so loved.</p></p><p>PETER KOCH (1904&#x2013;1986) was an acclaimed natural history photographer and documentary filmmaker and lecturer.

Most genetic defects will be removed at birth; the remaining during infancy. Unfortunately, there will be a generation left behind. For members of that missed generation, small advances will be made. Through various programs, they will be taught to get along in the world despite their differences. They will be made active and contributing members of society. But they will never be normal.<br></i><br>Lou Arrendale is a member of that lost generation, born at the wrong time to reap the awards of medical science. Part of a small group of high-functioning autistic adults, he has a steady job with a pharmaceutical company, a car, friends, and a passion for fencing. Aside from his annual visits to his counselor, he lives a low-key, independent life. He has learned to shake hands and make eye contact. He has taught himself to use &#x201c;please&#x201d; and &#x201c;thank you&#x201d; and other conventions of conversation because he knows it makes others comfortable. He does his best to be as normal as possible and not to draw attention to himself. <br><br>But then his quiet life comes under attack. It starts with an experimental treatment that will reverse the effects of autism in adults. With this treatment Lou would think and act and <i>be</i> just like everyone else. But if he was suddenly free of autism, would he still be himself? Would he still love the same classical music&#x2013;with its complications and resolutions? Would he still see the same colors and patterns in the world&#x2013;shades and hues that others cannot see? Most importantly, would he still love Marjory, a woman who may never be able to reciprocate his feelings? Would it be easier for her to return the love of a &#x201c;normal&#x201d;?<br><br>There are intense pressures coming from the world around him&#x2013;including an angry supervisor who wants to cut costs by sacrificing the supports necessary to employ autistic workers. Perhaps even more disturbing are the barrage of questions within himself. For Lou must decide if he should submit to a surgery that might completely change the way he views the world . . . and the very essence of who he is.<br><br>Thoughtful, provocative, poignant, unforgettable, <i>The Speed of Dark</i> is a gripping exploration into the mind of an autistic person as he struggles with profound questions of humanity and matters of the heart.</p><p>Corporate life in early 21st-century America is even more ruthless than it was at the turn of the millennium. Lou Arrendale, well compensated for his remarkable pattern-recognition skills, enjoys his job and expects never to lose it. But he has a new boss, a man who thinks Lou and the others in his building are a liability. Lou and his coworkers are autistic. And the new boss is going to fire Lou and all his coworkers--unless they agree to undergo an experimental new procedure to "cure" them.<p> In <i>The Speed of Dark</i>, Elizabeth Moon has created a powerful, complex, and believable portrayal of a man who varies radically from what is defined as "normal." The author insightfully explores the nature of "normality," identity, choice, responsibility, free will, illness and health, and good and evil. <i>The Speed of Dark</i> is a powerful, moving, illuminating novel in the tradition of <i>Flowers for Algernon</i>, <i>Forrest Gump</i>, and <i>Rain Man</i> . <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>&#x201c;<i>The Speed of Dark</i> gives a stunning, insightful and openhearted look at the world through the eyes of a man with autism. After reading this book, you will think deeply on the question: What does &#x2018;normal&#x2019; mean? Elizabeth Moon has written an outstanding testament to the unique gift every one of us has to share, exactly as we are, while also cheering us on to be all that we can be.

PreS These six titleslarge, splashy, practically indestructible books for toddlerscater to that audience of preschoolers who may still be rough on paper pages. Anna Bear's First Winter is a delightful book that tells of a bear's first experience with hibernation. It is enhanced by softly colored illustrations of the bears and of interiors of their country home and setting. Jamie Goes on an Airplane and Katharine Goes to Nursery School are reassuring books for two situations that can cause young children anxiety. Full-color photographs accompany these books. The Little Chick is a fairly humdrum story about a wayward barnyard chicken. It is not as fresh as the other animal stories in this series, but the lush, colorful drawings will sustain interest. Good Night, Little Rabbit is a bedtime tale in which the little bunny reminds his mom of all of the things she forgot, from a glass of water to a goodnight kiss. The differences between owning a live pet and a stuffed one and the responsibilities and joys of the former are deftly told in The New Puppy. All in all, these oversized board books are lots of fun and will be an excellent purchase for toddler collections. Janet E.

Long before Oliver Stone started pontificating, there was Stanley Kramer. As producer and then director, this self-proclaimed and lifelong New Dealer was responsible for any number of big, self-important ``message'' pictures, such as Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, Death of a Salesman, and On the Beach. These made enough money to keep him in the business, but a substantial portion flopped dramatically at the box office. (Even the flops, however, were showered with Academy Award nominations.) Early in his career, under a contract with Columbia's legendary Harry Cohn, Kramer managed to produce ten money-losers in a row, then redeemed himself on the eleventh picture, The Caine Mutiny. It's a remarkable story, but Kramer fails to display the requisite introspection and anecdotal flair. Much of this strangely bloodless memoir reads more like a ledger book than a life, a balancing up of profits and losses, with little consideration of all that lies beyond the numbers. From childhood, Kramer knew he wanted to work in the movies, but quick success eluded him as he labored in a variety of minor jobs, such as moving props. After WW II, he returned to Hollywood determined to make it as an independent producer (a great rarity at the time). With a lot of chutzpah and drive and the usual dollop of luck, he was soon well established, but his desire for control then took him naturally into directing. But don't look for any analysis of his directing technique or for thoughts on working with actors. Kramer is in too much of a hurry to get every fact down to bother with such illumination. This book, so lightweight, so lacking in any ``message,'' would never make it as a Stanley Kramer picture. (b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Legendary Hollywood producer/director Stanley Kramer touts himself as "the most frequently picketed producer in movie history," a distinction to which he is entitled as the force behind such landmark films as <i>Guess Who's Coming to Dinner</i>, <i>On the Beach</i>, <i>High Noon</i>, and <i>The Wild One</i>. Kramer tells a remarkable history of life in Hollywood during the depths of the McCarthy era and other cold war exigencies. His memoir captivates the reader with anecdotes from working with such troublesome stars as Marlon Brando and Humphrey Bogart as well as the legendary misanthrope Harry Cohn, president of Columbia Pictures, Kramer's boss and chief nemesis. But the memoir is most noteworthy for its exemptions. Written in a crisp, clipped prose, the book is nearly all business. Brief opening passages describe growing up on the streets of Hell's Kitchen in Lower Manhattan, but few formative interests. Kramer states his politics as a "Roosevelt democrat," but nothing on how he reached that position. A paragraph is devoted to his 12-year marriage. Consumed by his crusade to make challenging films for a complacent America, Kramer gives the impression that Hollywood was his life. <i>Ted Leventhal</i></p><h2>Eugene V.

This lyricism is steeped in an ambiguous sense of our planet&#x2019;s vulnerability in this nuclear age. Jaccottet&#x2019;s work has now developed steadily over nearly four decades as Derek Mahon points out in his introductory essay. In themes and form it will not seem alien to English language readers, yet Jaccottet&#x2019;s voice is his own.

He has lived in France since 1953, working as a translator and freelance writer. As well as poetry, he has published prose writings, notebooks and critical essays.

After withdrawing it, they discovered a need to revive and greatly expand their cavalry units in 1943-45. The Army and Waffen-SS cavalry proved their worth on the Russian Front, supported by other Axis cavalry contingents - Romanian, Hungarian, Italian, and locally recruited.

Maxim's remarkable new thriller -- which anticipates the development of unstoppable viral weapons -- is reassuring in at least one regard: It has threatened and angered Paul Bannerman.</p><p>The story begins not in Westport, Connecticut, where Bannerman and a group of his deadliest operatives have been trying to live otherwise normal lives, but in a fortified estate outside Washington, D.C., where the billionaire sociopath Artemus Bourne has taken delivery of a package. It was supposed to contain samples of horrific bio-weapons that one of his offshore firms created. Instead, the package held three severed heads. One belonged to the scientist who'd developed those weapons. The other two belonged to men who'd tested the virus on humans.</p><p>Bourne knows who sent him the three heads and why; it is an act of vengeance by a man long thought dead. He is out of Bourne's reach, but Bourne knows that man's one weakness -- a woman who is the great love of his life. If Bourne can find her, his problem might be nipped in the bud.</p><p>But Bourne's solution puts him at odds with Paul Bannerman, himself a friend of this woman. And Bannerman has a number of "ghosts" of his own, so-called because they, too, are thought to be dead and beyond the reach of the living. But none of them are beyond the reach of Artemus Bourne's deadly viral weapons. If Bannerman does not agree to stand down, anything in Westport that breathes will die.</p><p>This new Bannerman adventure, long awaited and much requested, is a heart-stopping tale ripped from today's headlines. It is also a tale of loyalty, of honor, and of a love that transcends life and death.</p></p><p><p>John R. Maxim is the author of the critically acclaimed thrillers <em> Mosaic, Haven, </em> and <em>The Shadow Box</em> and other highly praised novels, including <em>Time Out of Mind, Abel Baker Charley,</em> and the best selling Bannerman series. He makes his home in Hilton Head, South Carolina.</p>Travelers to Westport, Conn., should keep an eye open for unusual characters. That distinguished old gent who runs an antique shop? He's an ex-KGB colonel. That red-haired woman whose bookstore sells a lot of Harry Potters? She's a professional killer who likes to blow up trucks and planes. And the owners of a popular restaurant, a quaint bed-and-breakfast, a home security firm? They're all former assassins for the U.S. government, possessed of various violent skills that they're ready to exercise once again if their boss, Paul Bannerman-who runs a travel agency on the Boston Post Road-gives the word. We encounter them all again as thriller veteran Maxim takes up his successful series where Bannerman's Promise left off. Artemus Bourne, who puts the "arch" in "arch villain," is straight out of Ian Fleming-a fabulously wealthy and powerful smuggler, currently involved in the dirty African diamond business, who can't seem to hire good help. Bourne wants revenge on an Angolan rebel, Alameo, who messily beheaded three of Bourne's aides. Bourne knows that Alameo is really a former East German (and Bannerman colleague) named Martin Kessler, long believed to be dead. To trap Kessler, Bourne needs Kessler's lover, Elizabeth Stride, a legendary assassin called the Black Angel. Stride is also supposed to be dead, but in fact she's another of Bannerman's "ghosts" in retirement in Westport-and Bannerman may have to marshal some of his own deadly skills to protect her. The entertaining-if somewhat ludicrous-plot involves a good deal of hokum, blarney and old-fashioned excitement. Maxim's fans are in for more fun. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Indian Larry: Chopper Shaman</h2><p>A stunt man and side show performer made famous by the Discovery Channel, Indian Larry Desmedt is best remembered for his remarkable custom motorcycles, his wild tattoos, and his love for building and riding rolling art.

In <b>Disarmed</b>, Gregory Curtis gives us the &#x201c;life&#x201d; of this magnificent representation of life. <br><br>Using memoirs, letters, and official accounts, Curtis takes us up close to events. We see the Venus unearthed by a farmer digging for marble building blocks on the Aegean island of Melos at the moment a young officer and amateur archeologist looking for &#x201c;relics&#x201d; happened by. We also see how the island&#x2019;s elders, excited by the Frenchman&#x2019;s offer of money, fought with their Turkish overlords over who owned her. We learn how the French pressed their claim and then, outwitting other suitors, brought her to the Louvre, where she became an immediate celebrity. <br><br>A passionate researcher, Curtis shows us Europe in the early nineteenth century, caught in the grip of a classical art mania and a burgeoning romantic Hellenism. He sketches a tale of rich historical intrigue, revealing just how far the Louvre was prepared to go to prove it had the greatest classical find of the era. He tells how this resulted in two magisterial scholars, one French and one German, battling over the statue&#x2019;s origins and authenticity for decades. <br><br>Finally, expanding on accepted research, Curtis offers his own ideas of who carved the Venus and when, and how she appeared in her original setting on the island of Melos. He ends with a tribute to the statue&#x2019;s beauty and eternal appeal.<br><br>A delightful, illuminating history of one of the most famous artworks of all time.</p><p>&#x201c;The Venus de Milo is probably the most famous sculpture in the world&#x2013;controversial from the first and much written about.

Its causes spanned many centuries; its consequences were as extraordinary as the battle itself.</strong></p><p>On September 9, 1513, the vicious rivalry between the young Henry VIII of England and his charismatic brother-in-law, James IV of Scotland, ended in violence at Flodden Field in the north of England. It was the inevitable climax to years of mounting personal and political tension through which James bravely asserted Scotland&#x2019;s independence and Henry demanded its obedience.</p><p>In <em>Fatal Rivalry</em>, George Goodwin, the best-selling author of <em>Fatal Colours</em>, captures the vibrant Renaissance splendor of the royal courts of England and Scotland, with their unprecedented wealth, innovation, and artistic expression. He shows how the wily Henry VII, far from the miser king of tradition, spent vast sums to secure his throne and elevate the monarchy to a new standard of magnificence among the courts of Europe. He demonstrates how James IV competed with the elder Henry, even claiming that Arthurian legend supported a separate Scottish identity. Such rivalry served as a substitute for war&#x2015;until Henry VIII&#x2019;s belligerence forced the real thing.</p><p>As England and Scotland scheme toward their biggest-ever battle, Goodwin deploys a fascinating and treacherous cast of characters: maneuvering ministers, cynical foreign allies, conspiring cardinals, and contrasting queens in Katherine of Aragon and Margaret Tudor.</p><p>Finally, at Flodden on September 9, 1513, King James seems poised for the crushing victory that will confirm him as Scotland&#x2019;s greatest king and&#x2015;if an old military foe proves unable to stop him&#x2015;put all of Britain in his grasp.</p><p>Five hundred years after this decisive battle, <em>Fatal Rivalry</em> combines original sources and modern scholarship to re-create the royal drama, the military might, and the world in transition that created this bitter conflict.</p> 8 pages of color; 8 pages black-and-white illustrations</p><p>George Goodwin is a history graduate of Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he was awarded a Foundation Exhibition.

But this was not the only fraught relationship between a 16th-century Scottish monarch and an English one that culminated in bloodshed. British historian Goodwin (Fatal Colours: Towton 1461) explores an earlier rivalry that played an influential role in the conglomeration of Great Britain 200 years later. While England's Henry VII sought to keep the peace, even giving his daughter Margaret in marriage to Scotland's James IV, Henry VIII took the English throne in 1509 as a teenager eager for glory. The monarchic brothers-in-law had much in common, and both were masters of majestic display, argues Goodwin, but while the more mature James regarded the display of might as a substitute for war, Henry regarded it as preparation for battle. Goodwin's detailed account of the events leading up to the clash at Flodden on Sept. 9, 1513, places James at the center of the story, and it provides a fresh and provocative take on the intertwined histories of Tudor England and Stuart Scotland. 8 pages of color, 8 pages of b&amp;w illus.

The previous occupant must have set the lighting to simulate a natural dawn, although on board a ship like this, day and night were nothing more than a consensus.</p><p>She washed as best she could in the sink before pulling on a blue T-shirt and the long denim skirt she used to wear on warm evenings back on Calgarth. There was a tiny mirror above the cabinet, and she brushed her hair and fastened it back. There were still shadows beneath her eyes, but her reflection didn&#x2019;t look quite so drawn as the one she&#x2019;d glimpsed in that bar window back on Soltaire.</p><p>There was no one else down in the hold. She was conscious of an out-of-place feeling, like being a guest in someone&#x2019;s home with no understanding of the unspoken rules.</p><p>She made herself a coffee and stood at the counter to eat a bowl of cereal and rehydrated milk. She&#x2019;d almost finished when footsteps clanged on the stairs. A few seconds later, Gracie stepped through the gap in the crates.</p><p>She gave Jamie a cool nod. &#x201c;Morning.&#x201d; She paused, as though scratching around for how this sort of exchange should go. &#x201c;Sleep all right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine, thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>Gracie opened the fridge, apparently satisfied that she&#x2019;d met her conversational obligations. As Jamie hurried down the last few mouthfuls, not inclined to linger in awkward silence, there was a sharp crackle of sound, and Callan&#x2019;s voice echoed through the hold, distorted by the comm.</p><p>&#x201c;Engineer to bridge immediately, please.&#x201d;</p><p>The message snapped off. Gracie didn&#x2019;t show any reaction to the peremptory summons, throwing a hasty cup of coffee together and heading back to the stairs. There was a brief collision of voices as she reached the top, and after a few seconds Lowry appeared.</p><p>&#x201c;Good night&#x2019;s sleep?&#x201d; he said.</p><p>She nodded. &#x201c;You?&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled. &#x201c;Not too bad. The engines take a bit of getting used to. Have you traveled much?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not that much. I went from Earth to Alegria when I was twenty-two, then Soltaire a few weeks ago. I did a couple of short trips when I was living on Alegria, but that&#x2019;s about it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not back to Earth at all?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just once.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have still have family there? I mean, did you have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Lowry rubbed his brow. &#x201c;Sorry. There&#x2019;s no right way to talk about it, is there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; Jamie said. &#x201c;My father died a few years ago, but my stepmother was still in Belsley. I&#x2019;m not sure where my half sisters were living. We didn&#x2019;t really keep in touch.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And your mother?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She died when I was fourteen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That must have been hard.&#x201d;</p><p>Jamie looked away. Twenty-four years ago and millions of miles away, and people still always wanted to know what had happened and how she&#x2019;d felt about it. It was as though you weren&#x2019;t allowed to leave anything behind.</p><p>The clank of a door provided a welcome distraction, and she looked up to see Callan walking through the gap. He nodded at the pair of them before shoving his tin mug under the hot-water tap and tipping a large spoonful of instant coffee into it.</p><p>&#x201c;Morning,&#x201d; Lowry said. &#x201c;Everything all right?&#x201d;</p><p>Callan nodded. &#x201c;We may be making another stop. We&#x2019;ve picked up a signal.&#x201d;</p><p>Jamie&#x2019;s heart gave a hopeful leap. More survivors. More proof that the statistics were wrong.</p><p>&#x201c;From where?&#x201d; Lowry asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Mining colony on Pangaea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t heard of it,&#x201d; Lowry said.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s in the Gemmel cluster,&#x201d; Callan said. &#x201c;Fairly wealthy, if I remember rightly. Small-scale platinum mining. Gracie&#x2019;s trying to raise someone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do we know who it is?&#x201d; Jamie asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Callan said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your basic distress beacon. Date-stamped a couple of days ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So we&#x2019;ll be landing,&#x201d; Lowry said.</p><p>Callan gave a noncommittal shrug. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see if Gracie gets any response. Then we&#x2019;ll make a decision.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; Jamie felt a sharp surge of adrenaline. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t just leave someone down there.&#x201d;</p><p>Callan tipped powdered milk into his coffee and swirled it around. &#x201c;Well, we can. If we can&#x2019;t raise anyone, I&#x2019;m not inclined to land on spec. We won&#x2019;t know the fuel situation.&#x201d;</p><p>The memories were shoving for space inside Jamie&#x2019;s head. Her cold stone floor, gritty and unyielding. Her arms wrapped tight around her body as she tried not to break into pieces, alone. And running through her mind, that relentless fugue&#x2014;zero point zero zero zero&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; She wrenched her thoughts back.</p><p>Callan&#x2019;s eyebrows went up. &#x201c;No?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She shook her head, trying to clear it. &#x201c;I just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whoever&#x2019;s down there, they may think they&#x2019;re the only one.&#x201d;</p><p>Callan was still looking at her, and she felt a flash of resentment. He&#x2019;d never had to face that possibility. None of them had.</p><p>&#x201c;Like I said.&#x201d; His tone was level. &#x201c;If Gracie can raise someone, then we&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What if they can&#x2019;t get to the comm in time?&#x201d; Jamie could hear her voice rising. &#x201c;What if they&#x2019;re injured?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a lot of what ifs.&#x201d; Callan tapped his fingers on the scratched surface of the kitchen unit. &#x201c;How about I add one? What if there&#x2019;s no fuel?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You stocked up on Soltaire,&#x201d; Lowry put in, his tone neutral. &#x201c;Do we have enough to take off again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Callan said. &#x201c;But it would mean another stop somewhere. That&#x2019;s an unnecessary complication.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Unnecessary?&#x201d; Jamie gave a harsh laugh. &#x201c;Saving someone&#x2019;s life?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s an established settlement,&#x201d; Callan said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like we&#x2019;d be abandoning them on some backwater to chase their dinner with a homemade bow and arrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But they&#x2019;d be alone.&#x201d; Jamie could feel a tremor trying to break through her. If she started shaking, she might not stop. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She broke off. The memory of those first hours was too close, too personal. But she had to make them understand. They couldn&#x2019;t just sail off into the void, never looking back. &#x201c;I was alone,&#x201d; she managed. &#x201c;I thought I was alone.&#x201d;</p><p>Callan sipped his coffee, studying her over the rim of the mug. &#x201c;You must have known you weren&#x2019;t. The infomercials said&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter.&#x201d; There was a panicked edge to her voice. &#x201c;When you wake up and there&#x2019;s no one&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She drew a deep breath. &#x201c;If we just fly on, and leave whoever&#x2019;s down there, we might as well have murdered them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;ll be survivors all over the place,&#x201d; Callan said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not responsible for every one of them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But we&#x2019;re responsible for this one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How do you figure that?&#x201d; Callan said. &#x201c;If we&#x2019;d never picked the signal up we&#x2019;d never have known there was anyone there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But we do know,&#x201d; Jamie said. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t stop knowing it just because it&#x2019;s not convenient for you.&#x201d;</p><p>A quick flash of anger crossed Callan&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Is that what you think? That I just can&#x2019;t be bothered?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Looks like it from where I&#x2019;m standing,&#x201d; she shot back.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re standing on my ship,&#x201d; Callan said. &#x201c;And if I hadn&#x2019;t picked the three of you up, you&#x2019;d still be standing on Soltaire.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And we&#x2019;re grateful,&#x201d; Lowry said. &#x201c;But Jamie&#x2019;s right. We can&#x2019;t just leave someone behind.&#x201d;</p><p>He drained his coffee and put the mug down. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see what Gracie picks up.&#x201d;</p><p>As he walked away, Jamie stared after him, a whole plethora of furious responses running through her mind. She wanted to scream, or hit something. But she knew she wouldn&#x2019;t. She never had. She&#x2019;d always kept everything shoved down inside her, growing harder and denser, hidden away, but never forgotten.</p><p>&#x201c;Let it go.&#x201d; Lowry stepped up to her side. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see what happens.&#x201d;</p><p>Back upstairs, she&#x2019;d just reached the door of her cabin when the comm crackled and Callan&#x2019;s voice came on.</p><p>&#x201c;Commencing approach to Pangaea in five minutes. Strap in for landing.&#x201d;</p><p>The tight knot inside Jamie&#x2019;s chest loosened. One of the other doors slid open and Rena appeared. Her hair was clumped at one side of her head, as though she&#x2019;d been sleeping, but her eyes were suspiciously red.</p><p>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Survivors,&#x201d; Jamie said. &#x201c;There was a signal.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;More survivors?&#x201d; Rena&#x2019;s hand went to her forehead, as though she were about to cross herself, but she caught herself on the edge of the movement and pressed her hands together in front of her chest instead. &#x201c;How many?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p><p>Jamie turned and walked along the corridor. After a few seconds there was a patter of feet and Rena fell in beside her.</p><p>She gave Jamie a quick, tremulous smile. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s starting. People will come together.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We need to get strapped in,&#x201d; Jamie said, before the other woman could get into her stride. &#x201c;Come on.&#x201d;</p><p>Callan&#x2019;s skill in handling the ship had been apparent when the Phaeacian had set down on Soltaire, and this landing was no less deft. Jamie barely felt a jolt as they touched down.</p><p>Callan appeared just as they were undoing their harnesses. &#x201c;You three stay well back in the hold,&#x201d; he said, walking toward the door.</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s out there?&#x201d; Rena asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No idea.&#x201d;</p><p>Jamie stared at him. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you speak to someone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. So stay back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You expecting trouble?&#x201d; Lowry said.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what to expect. You never know how someone will react when they&#x2019;re frightened, and stupid is hot-wired right into some people.&#x201d;</p><p>Sharp sunlight cut through the gap as the doors opened. Callan took a couple of steps outside, his hand resting on his gun, and then stopped. He stood still, looking at something out of Jamie&#x2019;s view, before turning and beckoning to them.</p><p>As Lowry and Rena hurried forward, Jamie hung back, conscious of an echo of the same feeling she&#x2019;d had on Soltaire. As long as they stayed safely sealed inside the walls of the ship, she didn&#x2019;t have to think about what was out there. She could choose to believe anything at all; that they were alone in the universe, or surrounded by living worlds, full of living, breathing people.</p><p>By the time she reached the entrance the others were walking down the gangway. The port was bigger than the one on Soltaire, and they&#x2019;d set down on one of three platforms around a central loading area. The sky was a darker blue than on any other planet she&#x2019;d seen, giving the place a pregnant, storm-heavy look despite the white-gold glare of the sun.</p><p>There were two people standing a few meters from the end of the gangway: a girl who looked to be in her early twenties, with a tall, thin lad of around eighteen or nineteen standing a few paces behind her, arms soldier-straight by his sides.</p><p>The girl was small and fair-haired, dressed in a pale blue dress that looked like something a child might wear to a party. It floated down to just above her knees, and her arms and legs were bare. Her expression was wary, and as Callan reached the end of the gangway, she held up a warning hand, shooting a quick glance over her shoulder at the lad.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; Her voice seemed too light and flimsy for the heavy, industrial surroundings. &#x201c;Could you stop. Please.&#x201d; The lad had risen up on his toes, shifting his weight back and forth, his gaze resting somewhere above the heads of the new arrivals. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I mean, he finds people difficult. It was hours before he&#x2019;d talk to me. But we get along fine now, don&#x2019;t we, Finn?&#x201d; She smiled over her shoulder. It looked forced, but the lad stopped his gentle rocking and nodded, a quick jerk of his head.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; Callan said.</p><p>&#x201c;Mila.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You the only two here?&#x201d;</p><p>Something flickered across the girl&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen anyone else.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not an answer.&#x201d; Callan had picked up on the careful shape of her response. &#x201c;Any sign of anyone else?&#x201d;</p><p>Unexpectedly it was Finn who replied. His voice was flat, his words delivered without intonation. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s the bad man.&#x201d; He had dropped his gaze slightly, so that he was staring at the flanks of the ship.</p><p>&#x201c;The bad man?&#x201d; Callan said.</p><p>Mila tried to smile. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing. Just a joke I made when I thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She broke off, reaching up to wrap a strand of hair around her fingers. &#x201c;I keep thinking there&#x2019;s someone here. Someone&#x2019;s moving things. Or maybe I did it. Or Finn. I&#x2019;m never sure.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a shrill note in her voice, and Finn went up on his toes again. Mila instantly turned to him, dropping into a soothing monotone. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, Finn, it&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;</p><p>Callan glanced around the landing site, then looked back at Mila, regarding her appraisingly. As Jamie moved farther down the gangway, she could see what he was looking at. The girl had a mottled shadow of bruising along her jawline and a healing cut in front of her ear. There was also the faintest suggestion of a fading black eye hidden beneath her careful makeup.</p><p>&#x201c;What happened to you?&#x201d; Callan asked.</p><p>Mila flushed. &#x201c;Someone hurt me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can see that,&#x201d; Callan replied. &#x201c;Is that someone your bad man?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. It was before.&#x201d;</p><p>Callan nodded, his expression still contemplative.</p><p>Mila&#x2019;s face creased in an anxious frown, and then her expression changed, and she lifted her hand to push her hair back from her face. It was a slow, deliberate gesture, and when she smiled at him, there was a hint of practiced coquettishness about it.</p><p>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Here we are.&#x201d;</p><p>The words sounded too old for her. They didn&#x2019;t fit with her child&#x2019;s dress and her thin frame.</p><p>Callan gave her a long, level look. &#x201c;Here we are. What now?&#x201d;</p><p>Mila glanced away, her mask slipping a little, as though she didn&#x2019;t have the right script for this. When she looked back, she was herself again, young and uncertain. It was as though she&#x2019;d shrugged on someone else&#x2019;s skin for a moment, but it hadn&#x2019;t fit.</p><p>She chewed at her thumbnail. &#x201c;Can we come with you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If that&#x2019;s what you want. We&#x2019;re going to the capital.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Anywhere with people,&#x201d; Mila said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care where it is.&#x201d;</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder as she spoke, and Callan followed the direction of her gaze. &#x201c;You really think there&#x2019;s someone else?&#x201d;</p><p>Mila shook her head slowly.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Callan&#x2019;s voice was sharp with impatience. &#x201c;What are you not telling us?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There was a gunshot,&#x201d; she said, after another long pause. &#x201c;A couple of nights ago.&#x201d; Her brow creased. &#x201c;At least I think there was. Maybe I dreamed it. I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did he hear it?&#x201d; Callan jerked his head toward Finn.</p><p>&#x201c;He sleeps really deeply.&#x201d; Mila&#x2019;s tone was defensive. &#x201c;But I know what I heard.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought you said you weren&#x2019;t sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Mila bit her lip. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t dream it. I just told myself that. I know what it was.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shots.&#x201d; There was a hint of skepticism in Callan&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;From a bad man who&#x2019;s hiding and doesn&#x2019;t want to be seen. Maybe he decided to end it all, and that&#x2019;s what you heard.&#x201d;</p><p>Mila&#x2019;s expression darkened. &#x201c;No. I think there was someone else. The bad man&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he&#x2019;s still here. Sometimes I hear him at night, scratching around, as if he&#x2019;s trying to scare us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He?&#x201d; Callan said, as though it had just occurred to him.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what it feels like.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you haven&#x2019;t gone looking for him?&#x201d; Callan said.</p><p>A hint of anger sparked in Mi...</p></p><h2>Till the Butchers Cut Him Down</h2><p>When P.I.

Reprint.</p><p><p>Martha Wells is the author of seven fantasy novels, including Wheel of the Infinite, City of Bones, The Element of Fire, and the Nebula-nominated The Death of the Necromancer. Her most recent novels are a fantasy trilogy: The Wizard Hunters, The Ships of Air, and The Gate of Gods, all currently out in paperback from HarperCollins Eos. She has had short stories in the magazines Black Gate, Realms of Fantasy, Lone Star Stories, and Stargate Magazine, and in the Tsunami Relief anthology Elemental and The Year&#x2019;s Best Fantasy #7. She has essays in the nonfiction anthologies Farscape Forever and Mapping the World of Harry Potter from BenBella Books. She has also written two media-tie-in novels, Stargate Atlantis: Reliquary and Stargate Atlantis: Entanglement. Her books have been published in eight languages, including French, Spanish, German, Russian, and Dutch, and her web site is www.marthawells.com.</p>Wells's second novel (after The Element of Fire) is a delight: an SF adventure with complex characters, archeological puzzles, a dash of mental magic and a lot of fast-paced action. Khat and his partner, Sagai, make their living finding relics that survived the destruction of the Ancients and selling them to the highest bidders. Khat is a Krisman (a bioengineered human whose race was designed for the grueling desert environment most of his world has become), which places him even lower on the social scale than his foreign-born partner. The two are coerced into working with the Patrician Warder, Elen, who is searching out a specific relic for her mentor, the Master Warder. Warders have certain mental powers, although overusing these powers can cause them to go mad. The Master Warder believes that this particular relic will enhance his powers without causing insanity, but Khat and Elen discover that there is a terrible price to be paid for using the artifact, one that may bring about the final destruction of their already ailing planet. This finely crafted novel expertly combines several genres?SF, fantasy, horror?and, perhaps most impressive of all, even manages to avoid an overly sentimental ending. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Discovery of the Greek Bronze Age</h2><p><p> J. Lesley Fitton traces this exciting tale of scholarly discovery and weaves it into an engaging, in-depth portrait of Greek Bronze Age civilizations, from their dawning on the Cycladic Isles in the third millennium B.C. to their later flowering in Minoan Crete and then in the Mycenaean centers and finally to their mysterious disappearance in the twelfth century B.C. The result is an elegant assimilation of vast historical detail and a well-illustrated tour of the art and artifacts, the grand palaces and tombs, the mythical heroes and Trojan treasures that form at least one cradle of our own civilization. </p><p> Fitton begins with the early finds of travelers, advances in geology, and research into Homer's identity. She vividly recreates the heroic age of the first archaeological excavations, particularly Heinrich Schliemann's fascinating work at Troy and Mycenae, and Arthur Evans's pioneering excavation and restoration of the Palace of Minos on Crete. The persistent search for signs of writing among Bronze Age Greeks culminates in Fitton's description of the 1952 deciphering of the earliest script used to write Greek. And as her account extends into the present, it encompasses the important contributions of the archaeologists Alan Wace and Carl Blegen, the War's impact on research, and a concise summation of current scholarly trends. </p></p><p><b>J. Lesley Fitton</b> is a curator in the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities in the British Museum, where she specializes in the Greek Bronze Age.Fitton's book is an authoritative, well illustrated and highly readable history of [Heinrich] Schliemann's pioneering excavations, the discoveries that followed them and those still under way. She deals with the spirited and sometimes rancorous controversies to which these discoveries have given rise and chronicles the developments of new methods and attitudes in archaeology. But she also presents the reader with vivid portraits of the personalities and accomplishments of a series of individuals who, like Schliemann, devoted their lives to the search for that lost world which, before Schliemann's excavations, had been dismissed as myth and epic fantasy. They are a fascinating crew. (Bernard Knox <i>New Republic</i>)<br><br>The author's extensive knowledge, readable style, and copious illustrations provide an entertaining and engrossing introduction to a story of historical discovery that is far from at an end. (Thomas Martin <i>History Book Club News</i>)<br><br>This intelligent and well-informed book provides a wealth of detail about the discoveries of the past 120 years and the archaeologists who made them. Ancient views of the 'heroic' past are summarized in the first chapter, and the final one reports on the results of new work, such as the recent excavations at Thera, Keos, and Troy, the Ulu Burun shipwreck, and the frescoes of Minoan type from Avaris in Egypt. The author's accounts of famous archaeologists--Schliemann at Troy and Mycenae, Evans at Knossos--are enlivened by her awareness of modern critiques of their lives and works...The book is accessible to the general reader--may it inspire many a future archaeologist!--and it will also be useful for researchers in allied fields and even for Greek prehistorians who want to brush up on the development of their discipline...The range of discoveries covered is remarkably complete and the illustrations effective, particularly those in color. Fitton's book has filled an important gap, since nothing quite like it is now available in English. It is likely to be widely read for many years to come. (John E. Coleman <i>Classical World</i>)<br><br>[Fitton] shows an encyclopedic grasp of details, but rarely lets this disrupt or obscure the flow of her narrative...[A]ll in all, Fitton succeeds admirably in what she sets out to do--to present an entertaining, condensed version of the men who discovered the Greek Bronze Age. (Ruth Palmer <i>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</i>)<br><br>Lesley Fitton has written a fluent and useful account of the modern rediscovery of the Greek Bronze Age, with a focus on the early phases of archaeological exploration. While it will benefit the non-specialist most, those with an interest in the lives of the great excavators and the history of their discoveries will also find it of interest. Fitton's book is beautifully designed and produced, enlivened by many illustrations. (<i>New England Classical Journal</i>)<br><br>When Heinrich Schliemann excavated Troy and Mycenae in the 1870s, he inaugurated a new era of archaeological study of the ancient Greek world. Today, the number of Aegean archaeologists continues to grow at an astounding rate. J. Lesley Fitton's informative and very readable <i>Discovery of the Greek Bronze Age</i> tells the story of this century of discovery--beginning with the 'heroic' age of Greek archaeology, when pioneers like Schliemann and Sir Arthur Evans were loosening the soils of the Greek past at Troy, Mycenae and Knossos. Fitton describes how Aegean archaeology has slowly illuminated the places, objects and peoples of a world previously shaped by hazy legends and myths. (James D. Muhly <i>Odyssey</i>)<br><br>The story of the rediscovery of the Greek Bronze Age is not a new topic, yet Fitton brings to the subject an interest in the intellectual milestones, historical circumstances, and confluence of disciplines that brought it about. The result is not simply a chronicle of discoveries and discoverers but also a lucid survey of changing methods of study and the creation of an increasingly nuanced picture of early Greece. (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>In an exciting, useful, attractively illustrated study, Fitton, a curator at the British Museum, begins with the pioneering excavations of Troy, Mycenae and Minoan Crete by Heinrich Schliemann, Arthur Evans and others, then reviews the consolidation and reinterpretation of their finds by succeeding generations. She also discusses remarkable new finds.

She was born Olive Seers in 1901, the daughter of a prosperous Birmingham builder and decorator. Little is known of the author&#39;s early life but in 1926 she married microbiologist John Shimwell, with whom she moved to a small village near Cork in Ireland. This setting, transplanted to Devon, inspired her first mystery novel Knock, Murderer, Knock! which was published in 1938. The second of Harriet Rutland&#39;s mysteries, Bleeding Hooks, came out in 1940, and the third and last, Blue Murder, was published in November 1942. All three novels are remarkable for their black comedy, innovative plots, and pin-sharp portraits of human behaviour, especially concerning relationships between men and women. Olive and John were divorced in the early forties, and Olive apparently did not publish anything further. She died in Newton Abbot in 1962.</p><h2>Flights of Fancy: Stories, pictures and inspiration from ten Children&#39;s Laureates</h2><p><p><b>Walker Books celebrates 20 years of the Waterstones Children's Laureateship, in partnership with Booktrust.</b></p><p>The exceptional talents behind some of the nation's best-loved books &#x2013; from <i>The Gruffalo </i>to <i>The BFG</i>,<i> We're Going on a Bear Hunt </i>to the Charlie and Lola series <i>&#x2013;</i> the Children's Laureates are the perfect ambassadors for children's literature.

Robbins Landon rediscovers the composer through an accessible and musically informed biography. Presenting documentation about Vivaldi discovered after the Baroque revival in the 1930s, Robbins Landon explores a fascinating life.Short in length but long on scholarship, a ``life and works'' of the 18th-century Venetian master that belongs on the shelf of every serious music student. Robbins Landon, the distinguished musical archaeologist whose labors led to the rediscovery of much of Haydn's lost or neglected music, has also turned his attention recently to Mozart (1791, etc.). He now skips back a generation to focus on the composer whose name has become synonymous with the Italian baroque--not wholly new territory, since Robbins Landon also coauthored Five Centuries of Music in Venice (1991--not reviewed), but what prompted him to attempt a complete life of Vivaldi was the worldwide fascination with The Four Seasons. Prior to the 1950 Cetra recording of those four violin concerti, Vivaldi had been virtually forgotten for 200 years after having been buried in an unmarked pauper's grave in Vienna; today, he's one of the immortals. Yet Robbins Landon chooses not to speculate about the cause of the amazing ``Vivaldi renaissance.'' He's content to present a detailed, chronological, strictly factual biography, including Vivaldi's years as violin virtuoso and teacher of gifted orphan girls; his growing list of compositions; and his travels around Italy and, ultimately, Vienna--almost all undertaken in connection with his frustrated attempts to become established as an opera composer. Robbins Landon's method is to quote verbatim documents, letters, and dedicatory inscriptions in the original language (most are then translated): This exact but stern presentation may not appeal to the casual reader. The author inserts himself only long enough to recount his unsuccessful attempt to edit some of Vivaldi's many operas for modern presentation; he soon decided that the attempt was doomed. He notes that, unlike Haydn's operas and surely unlike Vivaldi's instrumental and religious music, Vivaldi's operas seem to offer little to contemporary listeners. But the author also has the good grace to hope that he'll be proved wrong. No fluff--just the facts and an invitation to explore the music.

But when he fails to make the grade as a college footballer, and takes a job with the local farmers&#39; co-operative, it seems he has finally settled into the rhythm and routine of everyday life. Outward appearances can be deceptive, however, as Jack proves: returning from a weekend conference with a new wife in tow, then leaving her behind and skipping town with a bundle of other folk&#39;s money. Nearly a decade later, no one has forgiven or forgotten, and when Jack reappears, resentment runs high. Once again though, it is Jack whose presence even more than his eight-year absence proves the most devastating.</p><p>The red Cadillac pulled down Main Street and sat by the tavern for hours, unnoticed. Then Ralph Bird of the Men's Store recognized the driver as Jack Burdette and bolted to the sheriff's office. The prodigal son of Holt, Colorado, had returned -- and he was far from welcome.<p>In Where You Once Belonged, acclaimed novelist Kent Haruf tells of a small-town hero who is dealt an enviable hand -- and cheats with all of the cards. In prose as lean and supple as a spring switch, Haruf describes a high school football star who wins the heart of the loveliest girl in the county and the admiration of men twice his age. Fun-loving, independent, Burdette engages in the occasional prank. But when he turns into a man, his high jinks turn into crimes -- with unspeakable consequences. Now, eight years later, Burdette has returned to commit his greatest trespass of all. And the people of Holt may not be able to stop him. Deftly plotted, defiantly honest, Where You Once Belonged sings the song of a wounded prairie community in a narrative with the earmarks of a modern American classic.</p>Kent Haruf&nbsp;is the author of five previous novels (and, with the photographer Peter Brown,&nbsp;<i>West of Last Chance</i>).

Joy Division, The Fall, Buzzcocks, New Order, The Smiths, Happy Mondays, Stone Roses, Oasis. These were the bands that shaped two generations of teenagers and changed the course of pop music. Manchester: Looking for the Light through the Pouring Rain is a portrait of these individuals, the city, and their times. Whether it be on a rain-soaked stage in Brazil, a rented room in Whalley Range, or on the dancefloor of the legendary Hacienda, Kevin Cummins&#39; exquisite photographs capture the anarchic energy of the Manchester pop moment. This stunning visual record of the city and its pop history is complemented by four textual contributions from Paul Morley, Stuart Maconie, Gavin Martin and John Harris. What is it about that city that makes it the Memphis of the UK? Cummins&#39; photographic record of the past 30 years captures the highs, the lows and the transcendent pop moments of Manchester&#39;s most famous sons.</p><p>Kevin Cummins was born in Manchester and was the NME&#39;s chief photographer for over a decade.

By the author of Road to Purgatory. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Max Allan Collins is the 2017 Mystery Writers of America Grand Master, a Lifetime Achievement Award winner from the Private Eye Writers of America, and the author of many books, including &#x201c;Road to Perdition,&#x201d; which became the Oscar winning film, and the Quarry novels, the basis for the hit TV series.This is Collins&#39;s third book about Michael Satariano, released a couple of years ago. The first two, ROAD TO PERDITION and ROAD TO PURGATORY, were dark, bloody masterpieces. Both were made into movies. Though this one is not of the same caliber, it&#39;s entertaining, as most Mafia-related books are. Michael, now a middle-aged casino manager in Reno, refuses Sam Giancana&#39;s request to kill a rival gangster. He&#39;s framed for the murder anyhow. Narrator Yuri Rasovsky is a bit off his mark. He reads too slowly, and often his voice cracks when it shouldn&#39;t. Nonetheless, his performance doesn&#39;t get in the way of the story. And his accents are wholly believable.

Leery of international embarrassment, the party is concerned about rumors related to Chairman Mao. Jiao, the granddaughter of an actress who had a 'special relationship' to Mao has moved into a luxury apartment and become involved with a new social set centered around the remnants of pre-Communist Shanghai society. All without any visible means of support.</p><p>Worried that Jiao has inherited some sort of artifact that could prove damaging to Mao's reputation, Chen has been given a few short days to infiltrate her social circle, determine if the feared material exists and, if it does, retrieve it quietly. And if he fails to solve this 'Mao case,' the consequences will be unpleasant for all concerned.</p></p><p><p>QIU XIAOLONG is a poet, professor and author of five previous novels featuring Inspector Chen. Born and raised in Shanghai, where he was a renowned poet and translator, Qiu lives with his family in St. Louis, MO.</p>Inspector Chen of the Shanghai police returns in his sixth book (following Red Mandarin Dress, 2007). Continuing to gain prestige among the party cadre, Chen is assigned a case so delicate he must keep it secret from the Special Case team and even from his dedicated assistant Yu. A young woman with black ancestors, Jiao has suddenly risen from poverty and appears at parties dedicated to reliving the glory days of the 1930s. Internal Security is worried about Jiao&#x2019;s growing power and especially about her connection to Mao (her grandmother was one of Mao&#x2019;s lovers), a link that could protect her from any kind of official censure. Using Mao&#x2019;s poetry and a censored biography, Chen investigates in his leisurely and unconventional style, posing as a rich businessman and aspiring writer. With the assistance of Yu&#x2019;s father, Old Hunter, Chen delves deep into the murk of the Cultural Revolution, uncovering Jiao&#x2019;s family history and her real connections to Mao. Full, as always,&nbsp;of crisp detail and vivid atmospherics evoking contemporary Shanghai, this latest installment further establishes the series&#x2019; stature on the international crime beat. --Jessica Moyer</p><h2>The Book of Ceremonial Magic: Including the Rites and Mysteries of Goetic Theurgy, Sorcery, and Infernal Necromancy</h2><p><p>Arthur Edward Waite writes <i>The Book of Ceremonial Magic</i> as a newer and more accurate edition of his previous title <i>The Book of Black Magic and of Pacts</i>, written in 1898. As most ancient texts on magical literature are rare and hard to come by, it becomes very difficult for modern scholars to ascertain an accurate knowledge of ancient spells and rituals. Waite responds to this lack of accessible literature and approaches this text as a methodical and systematic account of magical procedures of the past. He remains faithful to the original sources before making any conclusions by way of his thorough research methods. </p><p>Part I provides the reader with essential passages from leading magical texts from the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries. Part II is a more systematically organized version of these ancient texts, adapted by A.E. Waite to the ways of the modern academic. This volume remains one of the best sources of magical procedure, touching on such topics as gods, costume, and the planets and their relation to the supernatural. Although disapproving of the application of magic and the black arts in his introduction, Waite nonetheless defends those victims persecuted throughout history because of their participation in these superstitious beliefs. He also speaks positively about astrology and alchemy, noting them as more important categories of the magical arts. Through this volume, the contemporary reader can finally begin to understand the beliefs in the black arts that were so deeply rooted in our civilization's past.</p></p><p>Arthur Edward Waite (October 2, 1857 &#x2013; May 19, 1942) was a scholarly mystic who wrote extensively on occult and esoteric matters, and was the co-creator of the Rider-Waite Tarot deck. As his biographer, R.A. Gilbert described him, "Waite's name has survived because he was the first to attempt a systematic study of the history of western occultism &#x2014; viewed as a spiritual tradition rather than as aspects of proto-science or as the pathology of religion.CONCERNING THE INVOCATION OF EVIL SPIRITS <p>If we would call any evil Spirit to the circle, it first behoveth us to consider and to know his nature, to which of the planets it agreeth, and what offices are distributed to him from the planet. This being known, let there be sought out a place fit and proper for his invocation. according to the nature of the planet and the quality of the offices of the same Spirit, as mear as the same may be done. For example, if his power be over the sea, rivers or floods, then let a place be chosen on the shore, and so of the rest. In like manner, let there be chosen a convenient time, both for the wuality of the air--which should be serene, clear, quiet and fitting for the Spirits to assume bodies--and for the quality and nature of the planet, and so too of the spirit, to wit, on his day, noting the time wherein he ruleth, whether it be fortunate or unfortunate, day or nguht, as the stars and spirits require. </p><p>These things being considered, let there be a circle framed at the place elected, as well for the defence of the invocant as for the confirmation of the Spirit. In the circle itself there are to be written the general Divine Names, and those things which do yield defence unto us; the Divine Names which do rule the said planet, with the offices of the Spirit himself; the names, finally, of the good Spirits which bear rule and are able to bind and constrain that Spirit which we intend to call. If we would further fortify our circle, we may add characters and pentacles agreeing to the work. So also, and within and without the circle, we may frame an angular figure, inscribed with such numbers as are congruent among themselves to our work. Moreover, the operator is to be provided with lights, perfumes, unguents and medicines compounded according to the nature of the planet and Spirit, which do partially agree with the Spirit, by reason of their natural and celestial virtue, and partly are exhibited to the Spirit for religious and superstitious worship.</p></p><h2>Hurricane of Independence: The Untold Story of the Deadly Storm at the Deciding Moment of the American Revolution</h2><p><p><em>The sleeper history hit of 2008, released in paperback to coincide with the heart of hurricane season</em></p><p>On September 2, 1775, the eighth deadliest Atlantic hurricane of all time landed on American shores. Over the next days, it would race up the East Coast, striking all of the important colonial capitols and killing more than four thousand people. In an era when hurricanes were viewed as omens from God, what this storm signified to the colonists about the justness of their cause would yield unexpected results.</p> <p>Drawing on ordinary individuals and well-known founders like Washington and Franklin, Tony Williams paints a stunning picture of life at the dawn of the American Revolution, and of the weighty choice people faced at that deciding moment.</p><p><strong>Hurricane of Independence</strong> brings to life an incredible time when the forces of nature and the forces of history joined together to produce courageous stories of sacrifice, strength, and survival.</p></p><p><strong>Tony Williams</strong> taught history and literature for ten years and has a master's in American History from Ohio State University. He is currently a full-time author who lives in Williamsburg, Virginia, with his wife and children.Excerpt from Chapter One: Tempest Brewing<br><br>Throughout the summer of 1775, the sun scorched the desert sands of the Sahara. Easterly jets of wind raced a few miles up over the barren African terrain across thousands of bleak miles. As the winds hurtled toward the coastline, they became highly unstable and broke into pulsing waves. The waves stretched for up to a thousand miles and flew regularly over the shores of the coast every few days. The people of western Africa were left unawares of their existence except for the barest hint of a gentle breeze. But these winds eventually built into an explosive force half a world away.<br><br>The blowing winds jetted out over the blue waters of the Atlantic looking for just the right mysterious conditions to grow into a tropical depression. Some became troughs curving counter-clockwise because of the unfelt rotation of the earth. The infant storms needed desperately to feed on warm water if they were to survive.<br><br>The summer sun granted their wish, boiling the cauldron of equatorial Atlantic waters past eighty degrees. The heat sucked water right off the gently roiling ocean. It shot upward, cooling as it rose higher and higher. The vapor lifted miles into the air until it condensed into tiny water droplets that plummeted back toward the ocean whitecaps from whence they came.<br><br>Dark cumulonimbus clouds formed, menacing any sailors within sight. The intimidating thunderstorm hurled forked lightning bolts while thunder cracked raucously. Heavy downpours inundated hapless ships as the clouds were seemingly wringed all at once by Mother Nature.<br><br>Old, weather-beaten captains at the helms of their ships learned to expect these regular storms off the coast of Africa. The winds provided the propulsion necessary to transport their invaluable consumer and human cargoes across the wine dark sea. Frightened slaves were chained together and packed aboard the holds of ships, soon to replace those who were worked to death under sadistic masters in the brutal climate of the Caribbean sugar islands.<br><br>Captains of slave ships calculated the profits that each piece of human property would bring-if they made it to the islands. When squalls erupted suddenly near the Cape Verde Islands, sailors likely were not surprised by this common occurrence, despite the troughs that deceptively hid the storms behind crystal clear weather for many miles in front of them. The storms dropped torrential rain on the soaked men and replenished the water that they had skimmed off the ocean. The storms were harrowing, and many men were lost at sea, but the vast majority of ships came through and continued on to their tropical destinations. As bad as they were, most thunderstorms were spent after a few hours. They soon were replaced by more storms, pounding against other ships sailing along the same path.<br><br>A few storms survived, however. The growing tempests gobbled up enormous amounts of warm water that was fed into a swirling vortex that spiraled 'round and 'round, its pressure steadily dropping. <br><br>The swirling storm bulged into a monster with a giant eye in the middle of it. It hobbled along patiently around ten miles per hour, paralleling the equator, drawing more ferocity before it struck.<br><br> The natives of the Caribbean had a healthy respect for hurricanes and an uncanny understanding of nature. According to their beliefs, the wicked god, Hunraken, annually victimized the island people, inflicting them with destructive winds and deadly floods.<br>The natives were terrified whenever he made an appearance. They beat drums, shouted curses, and did everything possible to thwart the god and drive him away. Sometimes they successfully frightened him off; at other times his fury could not be withstood and they suffered the consequences.<br><br>The natives depicted the fearsome deity on primitive carvings as a hideous creature with swirling arms, ready to whip his winds and claim his prey. Natives had acquired a great store of knowledge through centuries of experience. Pale foreigners who settled on the tropical paradises, though, did not have the same meteorological understanding despite their advanced technology. Hunraken, however, had no regard for skin color: All were quarry for his wrath. On August 25, 1775, the evil god's arms stretched out hundreds of miles, packing winds with furious gusts. The god's arms were bands of rain that engulfed the islands of Martinique. Fierce winds bent trees, littering the ground with their tropical fruit. Large waves of clear water collided against reefs and beaches. Buildings and homes were easily ripped apart and blown down. Two days later, the storm descended upon the island of Santo Domingo. Both islands experienced "much damage" as a result of the "violent gale." The dwindling native population kept its traditions alive by ritualistically fighting the god of winds. But the beating drums of the natives were not strong enough to weaken the storm, nor was the small landmass of the islands. Hunraken gorged himself on the tepid waters and increased in intensity.<br><br>Falling pressure raised the ocean beneath the storm into a small dome of water that was hurled against the shallow shoreline of any landmass. For every inch the pressure dropped, the ocean lifted a foot. The hurricane created swells that projected far out to lap against the sands of the North American coastline. But swimming was not yet a leisure sport, and no one gathered on beaches for long vacations. Sailors were the only witnesses to the hurricane that was beginning to make its way up the North American coastline. Even if Hunraken spared their lives, though, they could not outrun the storm to warn anyone of its impending arrival.</p><h2>You Don&#39;t Look Fat, You Look Crazy: An Unapologetic Guide to Being Ambitchous</h2><p><b>&#x201c;<i>Carpe diem</i>, bitches.&#x201d; &#x2014;Ashley Longshore</b><br><br>Pour a glass of champagne, slip off your designer heels, pull up your big girl panties and enjoy pop-artist extraordinaire Ashley Longshore&#x2019;s unapologetic, raw, and <i>literally</i> laugh-out-loud funny guide to living an &#x201c;ambitchous&#x201d; life.<br> <br>For Ashley Longshore, the path from reluctant Southern Belle to badass artist and aspiring mogul hasn&#x2019;t always been a smooth one.

G. Wells, Amelia Earhart, and Albert Einstein, to name a few) join forces in the name of scientific discovery and human advancement. Operating under the name Plus Ultra, this brilliant group plans to reveal its most exciting project at the 1939 New York World's Fair, but, wouldn't you know it, the Nazis get in the way. As does a large, rampaging robot with its ability for human consciousness locked on revenge. Thrown into the mix are 17-year-old Lee Brackett and his mother, Clara. Who have come to New York for the world's first Science Fiction Convention. Mystery and action drive the narrative, while multiple character perspectives impart backstory fragments that keep the reader wanting more. Comic books play a pivotal role in the text, making the inked illustrations and minicomic at the book's end a nice touch. Though zeppelins and robots give this historic sci-fi adventure a steampunk flair, its plot is strictly high-voltage. Julia Smith Booklist"<br><br>Gr 5-8 In 1939, 17-year-old Lee Brackett accompanies his mother, Clara, to New York City. She wants to experience the World's Fair, and he wants to see Lou Gehrig play his final game before retirement. Clara, who is in the final stages of cancer, brings along a costume to better to blend in with the Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers wannabes at the World Science Fiction Convention. When she's given a comic book and special glasses, reality starts to bend. Chapter narrations move among various characters: Lee and Clara; members of Plus Ultra (such as Amelia Earhart, Albert Einstein, and Orson Welles); and pro-Nazis and their weaponized robots. Lee and Clara encounter physicists, pacifists, robots, humans with computerized brains, Hitler's henchmen, and an invisible Zeppelin, while occasionally traveling through space and time. Fans of superhero comics and blockbusters will easily imagine the action scenes. Occasional black-and-white illustrations accompany the text and a four-color comic book is bound at the back. In a twist on the "book into movie" model, this prequel feels like a preemptive "movie into book" spin-off from Disney's Tomorrowland movie, due out in May 2015. VERDICT This may find traction if the movie proves popular, but is an additional purchase as a stand-alone book.

He has been awarded the Irish Times Irish Literature Prize and the T. S. Eliot Poetry Prize, as well as the Yorkshire Post Prize for The Star Factory, published by Granta Books. Picador recently published his latest collection of poetry, The Twelfth of Never, alongside a reissue of The Ballad of HMS Belfast: The Belfast Poems.Imagine an Irish Borges constructing a Chinese puzzle of a text, describing his characters with Nabokovian relish and concocting a plot reminiscent of Dickens, H.G. Wells and The X-Files and you'll have an idea what Carson's fourth book of prose is like. In lapidary sentences, this fiction proceeds jigsaw-like through 101 brief chapters, each titled for a color from Paris Green to Bible Black. (Cataloguing more shades than anyone might imagine, the table of contents alone is worth the price of the book.) Although the narrator is introduced in the novel's first lines, he reveals surprisingly little about himself, not even his first name. (His surname turns out to be Carson.) Instead, he tells us about Napoleon dying on St. Helena from the fumes of Paris Green and proceeds to discuss Jan van Eyck's double portrait of Arnolfini and his bride, a painting whose importance grows as the novel progresses. Wending his way through the lives of the saints, the lives of Lambert and Jan van Eyck, the lives of Wittgenstein, Conan Doyle and Wilde, Carson craftily unfolds his story about young Carson; his cousin, Berenice; his schoolmate Maeterlinck; and a mission they can fulfill only by sipping Shamrock Tea and slipping into the world of Jan van Eyck's double portrait. This meander through fact and fiction is not new to Carson, a prize-winning Belfast poet, who in past works has turned his peripatetic mind from Ovid's Metamorphoses to Irish fairy tales to etymology and traditional Irish music. This mode clearly suits him, but because the disparate tales do not coalesce until late in this work, readers may lose patience, especially as the characters are "allowed no inner thoughts." But as a meditation on time and art, Carson's book sets its own benchmark. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Auntie Mame - Acting Edition (Acting Edition for Theater Productions)</h2><p>Publishers&#39; description: &#34;This fabulously successful hit hardly needs introduction.

Her grandmother is seventy-seven years old and crazy as in standing-on-the-balcony-firing-paintball-guns-at-strangers crazy. She is also Elsa s best, and only, friend. At night Elsa takes refuge in her grandmother s stories, in the Land-of-Almost-Awake and the Kingdom of Miamas, where everybody is different and nobody needs to be normal. <br>When Elsa s grandmother dies and leaves behind a series of letters apologizing to people she has wronged, Elsa s greatest adventure begins. Her grandmother s instructions lead her to an apartment building full of drunks, monsters, attack dogs, and old crones but also to the truth about fairy tales and kingdoms and a grandmother like no other. <br>"My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She s Sorry" is told with the same comic accuracy and beating heart as Fredrik Backman s bestselling debut novel, "A Man Called Ove." It is a story about life and death and one of the most important human rights: the right to be different."</p><p>Fredrik Backman is a Swedish blogger, columnist and author. His debut novel A MAN CALLED OVE was a number 1 bestseller across Scandinavia, has sold over one million copies worldwide, was a Richard &amp; Judy summer read in the UK and an instant New York Times paperback bestseller, and has been made into an acclaimed film. Fredrik's subsequent novels, MY GRANDMOTHER SENDS HER REGARDS AND APOLOGISES and BRITT-MARIE WAS HERE, also went straight to number 1 in Sweden on publication.My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She&#x2019;s Sorry 1<p></p> <br><br> TOBACCO<p></p> <br>Every seven-year-old deserves a superhero. That&#x2019;s just how it is.<br> <br>Anyone who doesn&#x2019;t agree needs their head examined.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s what Elsa&#x2019;s granny says, at least.<br> <br>Elsa is seven, going on eight. She knows she isn&#x2019;t especially good at being seven. She knows she&#x2019;s different. Her headmaster says she needs to &#x201c;fall into line&#x201d; in order to achieve &#x201c;a better fit with her peers.&#x201d; Other adults describe her as &#x201c;very grown-up for her age.&#x201d; Elsa knows this is just another way of saying &#x201c;massively annoying for her age,&#x201d; because they only tend to say this when she corrects them for mispronouncing &#x201c;d�j� vu&#x201d; or not being able to tell the difference between &#x201c;me&#x201d; and &#x201c;I&#x201d; at the end of a sentence. Smart-asses usually can&#x2019;t, hence the &#x201c;grown-up for her age&#x201d; comment, generally said with a strained smile at her parents. As if she has a mental impairment, as if Elsa has shown them up by not being totally thick just because she&#x2019;s seven. And that&#x2019;s why she doesn&#x2019;t have any friends except Granny. Because all the other seven-year-olds in her school are as idiotic as seven-year-olds tend to be, but Elsa is different.<br> <br>She shouldn&#x2019;t take any notice of what those muppets think, says Granny. Because all the best people are different&#x2014;look at superheroes. After all, if superpowers were normal, everyone would have them.<br> <br>Granny is seventy-seven years old, going on seventy-eight. She&#x2019;s not very good at it either. You can tell she&#x2019;s old because her face looks like newspaper stuffed into wet shoes, but no one ever accuses Granny of being grown-up for her age. &#x201c;Perky,&#x201d; people sometimes say to Elsa&#x2019;s mum, looking either fairly worried or fairly angry as Mum sighs and asks how much she owes for the damages. Or when Granny&#x2019;s smoking at the hospital sets the fire alarm off and she starts ranting and raving about how &#x201c;everything has to be so bloody politically correct these days!&#x201d; when the security guards make her extinguish her cigarette. Or that time she made a snowman in Britt-Marie and Kent&#x2019;s garden right under their balcony and dressed it up in grown-up clothes so it looked as if a person had fallen from the roof. Or that time those prim men wearing spectacles started ringing all the doorbells and wanted to talk about God and Jesus and heaven, and Granny stood on her balcony with her dressing gown flapping open, shooting at them with her paintball gun, and Britt-Marie couldn&#x2019;t quite decide if she was most annoyed about the paintball-gun thing or the not-wearing-anything-under-the-dressing-gown thing, but she reported both to the police just to be on the safe side.<br> <br>Those are the times, Elsa supposes, that people find Granny perky for her age.<br> <br>They also say that Granny is mad, but in actual fact she&#x2019;s a genius. It&#x2019;s just that she&#x2019;s a bit of a crackpot at the same time. She used to be a doctor, and she won prizes and journalists wrote articles about her and she went to all the most terrible places in the world when everyone else was getting out. She saved lives and fought evil everywhere on earth. As superheroes do.<br> <br>But one day someone decided she was too old to save lives, even if Elsa quite strongly suspects what they really meant by &#x201c;too old&#x201d; was &#x201c;too crazy.&#x201d; Granny refers to this person as &#x201c;Society&#x201d; and says it&#x2019;s only because everything has to be so bloody politically correct nowadays that she&#x2019;s no longer allowed to make incisions in people. And that it was really mainly about Society getting so bleeding fussy about the smoking ban in the operating theaters, and who could work under those sorts of conditions?<br> <br>So now she&#x2019;s mainly at home driving Britt-Marie and Mum around the bend. Britt-Marie is Granny&#x2019;s neighbor, Mum is Elsa&#x2019;s mum. And really Britt-Marie is also Elsa&#x2019;s mum&#x2019;s neighbor because Elsa&#x2019;s mum lives next door to Elsa&#x2019;s granny. And Elsa obviously also lives next door to Granny, because Elsa lives with her mum. Except every other weekend, when she lives with Dad and Lisette. And of course George is also Granny&#x2019;s neighbor, because he lives with Mum. It&#x2019;s a bit all over the place.<br> <br>But anyway, to get back to the point: lifesaving and driving people nuts are Granny&#x2019;s superpowers. Which perhaps makes her a bit of a dysfunctional superhero. Elsa knows this because she looked up &#x201c;dysfunctional&#x201d; on Wikipedia. People of Granny&#x2019;s age describe Wikipedia as &#x201c;an encyclopedia, but on the net!&#x201d; Encyclopedias are what Elsa describes as &#x201c;Wikipedia, but analog.&#x201d; Elsa has checked &#x201c;dysfunctional&#x201d; in both places and it means that something is not quite functioning as it&#x2019;s supposed to. Which is one of Elsa&#x2019;s favorite things about her granny.<br> <br>But maybe not today. Because it&#x2019;s half past one in the morning and Elsa is fairly tired and would really like to go back to bed. Except that&#x2019;s not going to happen, because Granny&#x2019;s been throwing turds at a policeman.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a little complicated.<br> <br><br> <br>Elsa looks around the little rectangular room and yawns listlessly and so widely that she looks like she&#x2019;s trying to swallow her own head.<br> <br>&#x201c;I did tell you not to climb the fence,&#x201d; she mutters, checking her watch.<br> <br>Granny doesn&#x2019;t answer. Elsa takes off her Gryffindor scarf and puts it in her lap. She was born on Boxing Day seven years ago (almost eight). The same day some German scientists recorded the strongest-ever emission of gamma radiation from a magnetar over the earth. Admittedly Elsa doesn&#x2019;t know what a magnetar is, but it&#x2019;s some kind of neutron star. And it sounds a little like &#x201c;Megatron,&#x201d; which is the name of the evil one in Transformers, which is what simpletons who don&#x2019;t read enough quality literature call &#x201c;a children&#x2019;s program.&#x201d; In actual fact the Transformers are robots, but if you look at it academically they could also be counted as superheroes. Elsa is very keen on both Transformers and neutron stars, and she imagines that an &#x201c;emission of gamma radiation&#x201d; would look a bit like that time Granny spilled Fanta on Elsa&#x2019;s iPhone and tried to dry it out in the toaster. And Granny says it makes Elsa special to have been born on a day like that. And being special is the best way of being different.<br> <br>Granny is busy distributing small heaps of tobacco all over the wooden table in front of her and rolling them into rustling cigarette papers.<br> <br>&#x201c;I said I told you not to climb the fence!&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny makes a snorting sound and searches the pockets of her much-too-large overcoat for a lighter. She doesn&#x2019;t seem to be taking any of this very seriously, mainly because she never seems to take anything seriously. Except when she wants to smoke and can&#x2019;t find a lighter.<br> <br>&#x201c;It was a tiny little fence, for God&#x2019;s sake!&#x201d; she says breezily. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing to get worked up about.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you &#x2018;for God&#x2019;s sake&#x2019; me! You&#x2019;re the one who threw shit at the police.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop fussing. You sound like your mother. Do you have a lighter?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m seven!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How long are you going to use that as an excuse?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Until I&#x2019;m not seven anymore?&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny mumbles something that sounds like &#x201c;Not a crime to ask, is it?&#x201d; and continues rifling through her pockets.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you can smoke in here, actually,&#x201d; Elsa informs her, sounding calmer now and fingering the long rip in the Gryffindor scarf.<br> <br>&#x201c;Course you can smoke. We&#x2019;ll just open a window.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elsa looks skeptically at the windows.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;re the sort of windows that open.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ve got bars on them.&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny glares with dissatisfaction at the windows. And then at Elsa.<br> <br>&#x201c;So now you can&#x2019;t even smoke at the police station. Jesus. It&#x2019;s like being in 1984.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elsa yawns again. &#x201c;Can I borrow your phone?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What for?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;To check something.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Online.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You invest too much time on that Internet stuff.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean, &#x2018;spend.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I beg your pardon?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What I mean is, you don&#x2019;t use &#x2018;invest&#x2019; in that way. You wouldn&#x2019;t go round saying, &#x2018;I invested two hours in reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x2019;s Stone,&#x2019; would you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny just rolls her eyes and hands her the phone. &#x201c;Did you ever hear about the girl who blew up because she did too much thinking?&#x201d;<br> <br>The policeman who shuffles into the room looks very, very tired.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to call my lawyer,&#x201d; Granny demands at once.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to call my mum!&#x201d; Elsa demands at once.<br> <br>&#x201c;In that case I want to call my lawyer first!&#x201d; Granny insists.<br> <br>The policeman sits down opposite them and fidgets with a little pile of papers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your mother is on her way,&#x201d; he says to Elsa with a sigh.<br> <br>Granny makes the sort of dramatic gasp that only Granny knows how to do.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why did you call her? Are you mad?&#x201d; she protests, as if the policeman just told her he was going to leave Elsa in the forest to be raised by a pack of wolves. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be bloody livid!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We have to call the child&#x2019;s legal guardian,&#x201d; the policeman explains calmly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am also the child&#x2019;s legal guardian! I am the child&#x2019;s grandmother!&#x201d; Granny fumes, rising slightly out of her chair and shaking her unlit cigarette menacingly.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s half past one in the morning. Someone has to take care of the child.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, me! I&#x2019;m taking care of the child!&#x201d; she splutters.<br> <br>The policeman makes a fairly strained attempt to gesture amicably across the interrogation room.<br> <br>&#x201c;And how do you feel it&#x2019;s going so far?&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny looks slightly offended.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well . . . everything was going just fine until you started chasing me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You broke into a zoo.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was a tiny little fence&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no such thing as a &#x2018;tiny&#x2019; burglary.&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny shrugs and makes a brushing movement over the table, as if she thinks they&#x2019;ve stretched this out long enough. The policeman notices the cigarette and eyes it dubiously.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, come on! I can smoke in here, can&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;<br> <br>He shakes his head sternly. Granny leans forward, looks him deep in the eyes, and smiles.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you make an exception? Not even for little old me?&#x201d;<br> <br>Elsa gives Granny a little shove in the side and switches to their secret language. Because Granny and Elsa have a secret language, as all grannies must have with their grandchildren, because by law that&#x2019;s a requirement, says Granny. Or at least it should be.<br> <br>&#x201c;Drop it, Granny. It&#x2019;s, like, illegal to flirt with policemen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Says who?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, the police for starters!&#x201d; Elsa replies.<br> <br>&#x201c;The police are supposed to be there for the sake of the citizens,&#x201d; Granny hisses. &#x201c;I pay my taxes, you know.&#x201d;<br> <br>The policeman looks at them as you do when a seven-year-old and a seventy-seven-year-old start arguing in a secret language in a police station in the middle of the night. Then Granny&#x2019;s eyelashes tremble alluringly at him as she once again points pleadingly at her cigarette, but when he shakes his head, Granny leans back in the chair and exclaims in normal language:<br> <br>&#x201c;I mean, this political correctness! It&#x2019;s worse than apartheid for smokers in this bloody country nowadays!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How do you spell that?&#x201d; asks Elsa.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Granny sighs as you do when precisely the whole world is against you, even though you pay taxes.<br> <br>&#x201c;That apartight thing,&#x201d; says Elsa.<br> <br>&#x201c;A-p-p-a-r-t-e-i-d,&#x201d; Granny spells.<br> <br>Elsa immediately Googles it on Granny&#x2019;s phone. It takes her a few attempts&#x2014;Granny&#x2019;s always been a terrible speller. Meanwhile the policeman explains that they&#x2019;ve decided to let them go, but Granny will be called in at a later date to explain the burglary and &#x201c;other aggravations.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What aggravations?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Driving illegally, to begin with.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean, illegally? That&#x2019;s my car! I don&#x2019;t need permission to drive my own car, do I?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; replies the policeman patiently, &#x201c;but you need a driver&#x2019;s license.&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny throws out her arms in exasperation. She&#x2019;s just launched into another rant about this being a Big Brother society when Elsa whacks the phone sharply against the table.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s got NOTHING to do with that apartheid thing!!! You compared not being able to smoke with apartheid and it&#x2019;s not the same thing at all. It&#x2019;s not even CLOSE!&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny waves her hand resignedly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I meant it was . . . you know, more or less like that&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t at all!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was a metaphor, for God&#x2019;s sake&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A bloody crap metaphor!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How would you know?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;WIKIPEDIA!&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny turns in defeat to the policeman. &#x201c;Do your children carry on like this?&#x201d; The policeman looks uncomfortable.<br> <br>&#x201c;We . . . don&#x2019;t let the children surf the Net unsupervised. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny stretches out her arms towards Elsa, a gesture that seems to say &#x201c;You see!&#x201d; Elsa just shakes her head and crosses her arms very hard.<br> <br>&#x201c;Granny, just say sorry for throwing turds at the police, and we can go home,&#x201d; she snorts in the secret language, though still very expressly upset about that whole apartheid thing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; says Granny in the secret language.<br> <br>&#x201c;To the police, not me, you muppet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;ll be no apologizing to fascists here. I pay my taxes. And you&#x2019;re the muppet.&#x201d; Granny sulks.<br> <br>&#x201c;Takes one to know one.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then they both sit with their arms crossed, demonstratively looking away from each other, until Granny nods at the policeman and says in normal language:<br> <br>&#x201c;Would you be kind enough to let my spoilt granddaughter know that if she takes this attitude, she&#x2019;s quite welcome to walk home?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell her I&#x2019;m going home with Mum and she&#x2019;s the one who can walk!&#x201d; Elsa replies at once.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell HER she can&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>The policeman stands up without a word, walks out of the room and closes the door behind him, as if intending to go into another room and bury his head in a large, soft cushion and yell as loud as he can.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now look what you did,&#x201d; says Granny.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look what YOU did!&#x201d;<br> <br>Eventually a heavyset policewoman with piercing green eyes comes in instead. It doesn&#x2019;t seem to be the first time she&#x2019;s run into Granny, because she smiles in that tired way so typical of people who know Granny, and says: &#x201c;You have to stop doing this, we also have real criminals to worry about.&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny just mumbles, &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you stop, yourselves?&#x201d; And then they&#x2019;re allowed to go home.<br> <br>Standing on the pavement waiting for her mother, Elsa fingers the rip in her scarf. It goes right through the Gryffindor emblem. She tries as hard as she can not to cry but doesn&#x2019;t make much of a success of it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, come on, your mum can mend that,&#x201d; says Granny, trying to be cheerful, giving her a little punch on the shoulder.<br> <br>Elsa looks up anxiously.<br> <br>&#x201c;And, you know . . . we can tell your mum the scarf got torn when you were trying to stop me climbing the fence to get to the monkeys.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elsa nods and runs her fingers over the scarf again. It didn&#x2019;t get torn when Granny was climbing the fence.

It was also one of the war's bloodiest and most pivotal battles, whose outcome would shape international politics for decades to come. </p><p> <i>The Last Battle</i> is Cornelius Ryan's compelling account of this final battle, a story of brutal extremes, of stunning military triumph alongside the stark conditions that the civilians of Berlin experienced in the face of the Allied assault. As always, Ryan delves beneath the military and political forces that were dictating events to explore the more immediate imperatives of survival, where, as the author describes it, "to eat had become more important than to love, to burrow more dignified than to fight, to exist more militarily correct than to win." </p><p> <i>The Last Battle</i> is the story of ordinary people, both soldiers and civilians, caught up in the despair, frustration, and terror of defeat. It is history at its best, a masterful illumination of the effects of war on the lives of individuals, and one of the enduring works on World War II.</p></p><p>12 1.5-hour cassettesCORNELIUS RYAN (1920-1974) was born in Dublin. He became one of the preeminent war correspondents of his time, flying fourteen bombing missions with the Eighth and Ninth US Air Forces and covering the D-day landings and the advance of General Patton's Third Army across France and Germany. After the end of hostilities in Europe, he covered the Pacific War. In addition to his classic works <i>The Longest Day, The Last Battle</i>, and <i>A Bridge Too Far</i>, he is the author of numerous other books, which have appeared throughout the world in nineteen languages.

Tour.</p><p>As business consultants, and in seminars, workshops, and previous books--<i>Type Talk</i> (1988) and <i>Type Talk at Work</i> (1992)--Kroeger and Thuesen, who are "life partners and business partners," have built a small industry around the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), which has its roots in Jungian psychology. Here, they explain the theory's 16 "types," defined by individual preferences within each of four dichotomies--"extraverted"/introverted, sensing/intuitive, thinking/feeling, and judging/perceiving--and then view the impact of these personality-type similarities and differences on "four keys to a lasting love": communication, sex and intimacy, finance, and conflict. A third section explains how "type talk" can help couples negotiate, establish contracts, and learn to cope with and even to celebrate their similarities and differences, while an appendix supplies brief profiles of the 16 MBTI personality types. The market for advice about relationships seems never to be saturated, and the <i>16 Ways</i> approach, while it may seem a bit mechanical, is more nuanced and complex than many of its pop-psychology competitors. <i>Mary Carroll</i>Kroeger and Thuesen, specialists in the business applications of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), wrote the best-selling Type Talk at Work ( LJ 1/92).

With this title comes the daunting task of saving his beloved campus from diminished enrollment, hockey thuggery, and its ignoble associations with Paul Bunyan. So when the most famous poet in America agrees to come to Rookery, Leland hopes that his reading will put Rookery State on the literary map.<br><br>But when he arrives, the poet is more and less than what Leland expected--and their relationship leads Leland on a wild ride that will compel him to harbor a fugitive, stand up to his domineering mother, and finally make peace with his brief attempt at love and the tragedy that ensued. . . .</p><p>Readers of Jon Hassler's <i>Rookery Blues</i> will remember Leland Edwards as a high-spirited young English professor and jazz pianist who, with like-minded fellow academics, formed a quartet called Icejam in 1969. In Hassler's latest novel, <i>The Dean's List</i>, Leland is 25 years older and a much sadder man. Now the dean of Rookery State College, a mediocre institution in northern Minnesota, Leland finds his administrative duties and his dying mother shouldering out what little energy or time he has for music. But if Leland Edwards has given up his dreams of a jazz career, he still has some hopes for his reputation as an academic. When a famous elderly poet, Richard Falcon, comes to Rookery State to work on what he hopes will be his final masterpiece, Leland sees an opportunity to put himself and his institution on the map. <p> <i>The Dean's List</i> is more melancholy than its predecessor. Still, Jon Hassler's inimitable style, his flair for character, and his well-limned portraits of Minnesota and its people lighten the shadow of gloom that hangs over Rookery State College this year.</p>I must say I didn't think that I'd really enjoy Jon Hassler's fiction because it's not the <br>kind of fiction I generally get into. But, when I read Dean's List I simply fell in love with<br>these small town characters and their foibles. I've now read several other Hassler<br>novels and am now a genuine fan of his work. The characters have a way of insinuating<br>themselves into your mindset and you find yourself thinking about them during the<br>quiet moments of your day.

Unfortunately, what might have been an abnormally interesting history of It-ness is marred by incomprehensible prose, endless sentences and turgid critical theory. Roach, a professor of theater at Yale, argues that the origins of It can be traced back to the late 17th century, or more precisely, to the period following Charles II of England's restoration to the throne. But It also appears to be a universal phenomenon. The Roman rhetorician Quintilian defined It as "the compellingly singular character of the great orator," while for Castiglione It was <i>sprezzatura,</i> the ability to turn heads when entering a room, and biblical prophets were confident It was a divine gift. Despite Roach's lengthy and demanding analysis, no one has come closer to defining It so perfectly and so succinctly as Elinor Glyn, the British romance author who first coined the term in 1927 (Clara Bow would be the first "It Girl"): "In the animal world 'It' demonstrates [itself] in tigers and cats&#x2014;both animals being fascinating and mysterious, and quite unbiddable."

I just hope that the people back there realize what everyone is going through for them.</p><p>&#x2014;Letter home, John McGarry, February 19441</p><p>ROBERT HALLIGAN STEPPED OUT of the familiar sweat-and-oil-and-cigarette stink of the dispersal tent and into the fresh, gray wet of the English morning. Only a handful of the 303rd&#x2019;s B-17s were visible through the fog. The gray blanket likewise muffled the aircraft-readying noises made by hundreds of maintenance men and their equipment as they prepared more than three dozen bombers for the day&#x2019;s mission.</p><p>There had been a mix-up in aircraft assignments, but it was finally settled that the John McGarry crew would fly <i>Spirit of Flak Wolf</i> to Marienburg, Germany; Halligan was the crew&#x2019;s navigator. The big ship hulked on its hardstand directly in front of him. Halting rivulets of water traced paths down its sides and gave it a muscular sleekness. Halligan watched the bomber&#x2019;s crew chief walk one of the four propellers through several revolutions to redistribute the oil that had drained into the lower cylinder heads overnight.</p><p>Swaddled in layers of flying gear, Halligan clumped to the forward access hatch under the nose of the B-17. He tossed his musette bag through the dark hole, grasped the edge of the opening and swung himself up and into the aircraft. His entry was fluid and easy. Experience had done that. The first time he tried to pull himself through the door&#x2014;during training back in the States&#x2014;he flailed and scrabbled and collapsed back to the ground in an embarrassed, out-of-breath heap.</p><p>Inside, Halligan collected the bag and ducked onto the narrow catwalk that ran beneath the pilot&#x2019;s compartment. Behind him he heard footfalls and the clanking of metal on metal as the other crewmen readied the equipment at their positions. As big as it was, <i>Spirit of Flak Wolf</i> still juddered gently as the men moved about and positioned their gear. Their voices were indistinct mutters that betrayed no emotion despite the fact that the mission was to be the 303rd&#x2019;s longest yet.</p><p>It would be Halligan&#x2019;s twenty-fifth mission. Had it been just a few months earlier it would have been his last. But just lately the required mission count had been raised to thirty. Halligan wasn&#x2019;t angry. Rather, he was resigned. In fact, he had been resigned for a long time. But it wasn&#x2019;t a giving-up sort of resignation; rather, it was an acceptance of fate. Whether he died or lived depended not only on his skill and that of his crewmates but also to an enormous degree on considerations over which none of them had control. On luck. Regardless, he was resolved to do his best&#x2014;he owed it to himself and to his comrades.</p><p>Still, the odds seemed to be closing on the McGarry crew. Of the previous twenty-four missions, the men returned to Molesworth with all four engines running on only four. Flak, fighters and mechanical gremlins dogged the crew on virtually every sortie.</p><p>Halligan settled himself at the little desk mounted to the left bulkhead of the aircraft&#x2019;s nose. There, he arranged his charts and checked them against the notes he had taken during the early morning briefings. <i>Spirit of Flak Wolf </i>was slated to fly near the rear of the formation and consequently, barring a catastrophe, the responsibility for getting to the target would not fall to him. However, it was imperative that he be continuously aware of the aircraft&#x2019;s position. He had to be ready to give McGarry an accurate heading home in the event the ship was separated from the rest of the 303rd.</p><p>Kenneth Foe, the bombardier, stepped up from the catwalk and into the nose with Halligan. The two men were joined by the sort of bond created only by shared terror. Together, in the glass-and-aluminum cage that was the nose of the aircraft, they had fought enemy fighters, endured flak and sweated out mechanical failures that could have forced them down over enemy territory, or worse, into the icy North Sea. Too many times they had turned to each other when their very survival was at stake. And although their faces were clamped under oxygen masks and goggles, their eyes had unerringly communicated the fear they both felt.</p><p>Halligan and Foe checked the four&nbsp;.50-caliber machine guns for which they were responsible. They heard McGarry and the copilot, Willie Cotham, in the pilot&#x2019;s compartment above and behind them. The flare signaling the time for starting engines was due momentarily. Halligan looked out through the water-spotted glass of the nose and noted that the visibility had not appreciably improved.</p><p>There was the flare&#x2014;a streak of yellow that disappeared immediately into the clouds. McGarry shouted and signaled through the window on the left side of the cockpit, and Halligan saw the crew chief nod and raise a thumb from where he stood outside in the wet. Two other ground crewmen stood ready with fire extinguishers. There was a murmured command in the cockpit, and then the left outboard engine&#x2014;number one&#x2014;whined and ticked as it slowly wound the propeller through two or three faltering revolutions. Then, the engine coughed blue smoke, caught and settled into a smooth, syrupy rumble that spun the propeller into a translucent disc. A low, vibrating growl thrummed across the airfield as the rest of the group&#x2019;s B-17s came to life.</p><p>The crewmen aboard the bomber were all business as McGarry and Cotham started the right outboard engine&#x2014;number four. The pilots would taxi the aircraft on only the two outboard engines in order to save precious fuel. The two remaining engines would be started just before takeoff. The interphone crackled as each man double-checked his equipment and reported his status. Halligan, alone in the nose with Foe, felt somehow comforted as <i>Spirit of Flak Wolf</i>, with engines running, no longer felt like a cold, inanimate machine. Rather, as did every aircraft, it vibrated with a subtle timbre that was its own&#x2014;almost as if it were a living thing.</p><p>Only a few minutes passed before both the bomber and its men were ready to go. A green flare arced up from the control tower, and the aircraft assigned to the front elements of the 303rd&#x2019;s formation rolled from their hardstands and onto the taxiways that ringed the field. Halligan knew that McGarry was ticking off the different bombers against a list as they taxied. It was imperative that he put <i>Spirit of Flak Wolf</i> where it belonged in the long line of big machines.</p><p>Finally, McGarry signaled the crew chief and immediately a ground crewman trotted around the left wingtip&#x2014;clear of the spinning propeller&#x2014;and pulled the wheel chocks away. There was another exchange of signals, and Halligan felt the aircraft shudder as McGarry advanced the B-17&#x2019;s two outboard engines. He looked left and returned the salute that the crew chief aimed at McGarry. He was never sure if the ground man saw him, but he always returned the salute on principle.</p><p>The aircraft ahead of <i>Spirit of Flak Wolf</i> blasted up mud and water and small stones. A clump of propeller-blown something made a muddy streak down the left side of the glazed nose. Halligan considered whether or not the climb through the clouds would wash it clean and guessed that it probably would not. Both he and Foe looked up when the aircraft was rocked, as if by a heavy wind. The pilot of another B-17 powered up its engines to pull a wheel clear of the sodden patch where he had let it wander, just off its hardstand. A rock ticked hard against the glass in front of Foe, and he reached up with his forefinger and touched where it hit.</p><p>There was another green flare and the mission leader started his takeoff roll. Halligan watched the heavily loaded bomber use most of the runway before pulling itself clear of the ground. A few seconds later it disappeared into the gray murk. The rest of the 303rd&#x2019;s aircraft followed at thirty-second intervals. A short time later McGarry and Cotham started the two inboard engines&#x2014;number two and number three&#x2014;finished their takeoff checks, and swung <i>Spirit of Flak Wolf</i> onto the runway. They pushed the throttles forward and let the engines settle into a smooth, ready roar before releasing the brakes.</p><p>Halligan noted that the aircraft was slow to move; the crew had never flown aboard such a heavily loaded ship. Nevertheless, the bomber did accelerate slowly down the runway. Stuck onto the front end of the aircraft as they were, Halligan and Foe had a view of the takeoff like no one else&#x2019;s. The B-17&#x2019;s initial jouncing damped into a smooth roll as the wings created lift and began to pull the aircraft from the uneven pavement. And then, at a distant point of the runway where none of the crew had ever been, <i>Spirit of Flak Wolf </i>was airborne. Halligan watched the ground disappear as the bomber<i> </i>hauled itself into the low-hanging clouds.</p><p>There was a sudden, mechanical roar and the aircraft lurched. Halligan felt it yaw even as McGarry and Cotham pushed the engines to full power. An engine had failed. Halligan&#x2014;even through the din of the hard-pressed motors&#x2014;heard the two pilots above and behind him strain as they wrestled with the bomber&#x2019;s controls. And then McGarry&#x2019;s voice came over the interphone. He sounded frustrated, but not frightened. He ordered the men to don their parachutes.</p><p>Halligan and Foe exchanged their fearful glances one more time. So soon after takeoff there were no oxygen masks to hide their faces. It occurred to Halligan that Foe looked old. And tired. Behind Foe, through the glass nose, Halligan saw the ground again. And trees. The load that <i>Spirit of Flak Wolf</i> carried was too heavy for it to climb on only three engines. There was a jolt and the B-17 tipped toward the ground and then bucked nose-high for a long moment before nosing over again. There was another crash, and Halligan blinked reflexively as Foe&#x2019;s body hurtled into his amid a spray of shattered glass and metal.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>DESPITE THE FOG, the thunderclap that <i>Spirit of Flak Wolf</i> made when it smashed into the ground near Winwick, on Easter Sunday, April 9, 1944, traveled for miles. The bombs it carried did not explode, but the big ship was ripped into smaller bits that were immolated when the fuel it carried ignited. Halligan, Foe, McGarry and Cotham were all killed, as was the engineer, Henry Grace, and the radio operator, Stephen Stuphar. Miraculously, the four gunners were thrown from the ship and survived, although they were badly burned and injured.</p><p>None ever returned to combat operations.</p><p></p><p></p><p>PREFACE</p><p>I WAS A FIGHTER PILOT. Like most fighter pilots I was sure that I was the best there ever was. Alone in the aircraft, I controlled my destiny. If I lived or died, there was one person to credit or to blame.</p><p>And that is why I am so fascinated by the bomber crews of World War II. Certainly the men who crewed the heavy bombers that were sent against Nazi Germany were flyers, but they enjoyed none of the soaring freedom of flight. Rather, they crawled into primitive, bomb-laden brutes and froze&#x2014;sometimes to death&#x2014;miles above the earth in enormous formations while being savaged by antiaircraft guns and fighters. Driven by a visceral loyalty to their comrades and their country, they hunkered down, thrashed through the enemy&#x2019;s defenses, dropped their bombs and fought their way home.</p><p>If they weren&#x2019;t shot down.</p><p>To some extent their skills and those of their crewmates determined whether they returned home or not. But to a greater degree their survival depended on luck. It was chance that put a bomber in the exact wrong place at the exact wrong time to be caught by a burst of flak. And providence decided whether or not a mechanical failure forced an aircraft out of formation to be set upon by enemy fighters. And it was fortune that determined if a badly damaged bomber slammed into another. In actual fact, the fates of the bomber men were largely out of their own control.</p><p>Indeed, flying heavy bombers against the Germans during World War II was akin to a complex, airborne variation of Russian roulette. And that is why I believe these flyers were the most valiant airmen ever. The decision these men made to climb aboard a bomber, mission after mission, while knowing that a safe return was never certain&#x2014;regardless of their skill or experience&#x2014;was a splendidly brave one.</p><p>Of more than forty Eighth Air Force bomb groups I chose the 303rd&#x2014;&#x201c;Hell&#x2019;s Angels&#x201d;&#x2014;for several reasons. Firstly, it was one of the original units to start heavy bombardment operations against Germany. This allowed me to use the unit to provide an overview of the story, from beginning to end, of the Eighth Air Force&#x2019;s strategic bombing effort. Next was the fact that the unit&#x2019;s records are extensive, well organized and readily available. Decades after the war the 303rd formed an association, and many men&#x2014;Harry Gobrecht chief among them&#x2014;labored assiduously to preserve the group&#x2019;s legacy. Finally, there was the fact that although the 303rd was a standout unit, its operations were typical of all the Eighth Air Force&#x2019;s heavy bomb groups.</p><p>However, that being said, the 303rd&#x2019;s achievements were remarkable. The B-17, <i>Hell&#x2019;s Angels</i>, from which the group took its name, was the first Eighth Air Force bomber to fly twenty-five missions. Another of the group&#x2019;s aircraft, <i>Knockout Dropper</i>, was the first to surpass both the fifty- and seventy-five-mission marks. The unit was the first in the Eighth Air Force to reach the two- and three-hundred-mission milestones. Further, the 303rd flew more missions from England&#x2014;364&#x2014;than any other bomb group. And only one other unit dropped more bomb tonnage. Lewis Lyle commanded one of the 303rd&#x2019;s squadrons before becoming the group&#x2019;s deputy commander; he later led his own bomb group. He flew an incredible sixty-nine missions&#x2014;more than any other Eighth Air Force bomb group commander. Moreover, the bravery of the 303rd&#x2019;s airmen was never questioned and was personified by Jack Mathis and Forrest Vosler. Both were awarded the Medal of Honor.</p><p>Too many histories of the air war over Europe during World War II concentrate only on the terror of air combat. Overdone, this can leave the reader numb, even bored. Consequently, I have worked to describe not only the horrors of the air battles, but also why, how and by whom those battles were fought. I have also gone to some length to describe the roles of the maintenance and support personnel; not a single bomber would have gotten airborne without them. Indeed, for every airman there were approximately ten men who toiled on the ground to support him. Within these pages, for brevity&#x2019;s sake, I have included the various support groups under the 303rd&#x2019;s umbrella. But I believe they merit mention by name at least once. They were the 444th Sub Depot, the 3rd Station Complement Squadron, the 1681st Ordnance Company, the 1199th Military Police Company, the 863rd Chemical Company, the 1114th Quartermaster Company and the 202nd Finance Company.</p><p>The 303rd and its support units comprised a bombing organization the size of a large town&#x2014;approximately four thousand men at any one time.

A first novel. 12,500 first printing. First serial, Grand Street Review.</p><p><p>David Searcy was recently awarded an NEA Creative Writing Fellowship grant.</p>Those in search of subtle literary horror need look no farther than this fine debut novel. Frank Delabano is a quiet, elderly man living alone in the great flatness of an aging housing development. His rose garden is out of the ordinary in this most ordinary of places. "It's the sentimental absorbency of roses that's most valuable to him, in factArelieves him of any lingering sorrows, draws them off and releases them to the air." When little piles of dirt erupt in the flower beds, Mr. Delabano suspects gophers and is determined to be rid of them. He mail-orders some "gopherbane," an exotic nonflowering South American plant guaranteed to repel his garden varmints without harming anything else. The plants turn out to have buds that blossom into odd large blue flowers, but they do prevent the pests. Once the plants are part of the garden, however, ever-increasing feelings of disturbance and fear pervade Mr. Delabano's existence. His neighbors, the Getzes, and their troubled little daughter, Janie, become part of the uneasy new atmosphere. As the reader is drawn into its mystifying strangeness, the novel's progress depends on its characters more than plot. One is never quite sure of what to be sure of. Is the mounting sense of fear real or an extension of distorted psychology? Poetic present-tense prose enhances the disconcerting sensation. Audaciously original, emotionally effective, this is a more than ordinary horror novel.

Friis is a journalist by training, while Kaaberb�l has been a professional writer since the age of 15, with more than 2 million books sold worldwide. Their first collaboration, <i>The Boy in the Suitcase</i>, was a <i>New York Times</i> and<i> USA Today </i>bestseller, has been translated into 30 languages, and has sold half a million copies worldwide. They are also the authors of two other Nina Borg novels in addition to <i>The Boy in the Suitcase</i>: <i>Invisible Murder</i> and <i>Death of a Nightingale</i>.<i>The confessional was empty. Otherwise he wouldn&#x2019;t have gone in. It was hushed and dim&#x2014;almost cool after the moist, stinking tropical heat of Manila&#x2019;s streets&#x2014;and he could smell the beeswax the women of the congregation used when they polished the dark wooden panels. His right hand moved involuntarily in an ancient pattern&#x2014;forehead to chest, left shoulder to right shoulder&#x2014;but he didn&#x2019;t know how to begin. Then it came, abruptly and without preamble.</i><br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I have to kill someone,&#x201d; he whispered at the small curtain and the confessional&#x2019;s empty side. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I can do it. But I can&#x2019;t not do it. Help me!&#x201d;</i><br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He would have been terrified if there had been an answer. Instead the silence swallowed his words without giving him anything in return, and when after a few minutes he got up and left, he felt neither lighter of heart nor less fearful.</i><br>The second blow hit Nina on the back of the neck, right where the skull meets the cervical vertebrae. She fell forward. The cement rose to meet her, and she was already so numb that the abrupt contact didn&#x2019;t hurt. She lay on the parking garage&#x2019;s grubby, oil-stinking concrete deck, incapable of creating a connection between her bruised brain and the arms and legs she should have been mobilizing in order to save herself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had dropped the SuperBest bags with the first blow. A can of diced tomatoes rolled across the concrete, so close that she could have touched it if her arms and hands were still functioning, and right in the center of her foggy field of vision an object hit the floor with a drawn-out metallic clatter&#x2014;an iron pipe, dark-brown with rust, as if it had been lying outside for years in some nettle-covered trash heap behind a shed. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone dropped to his knees beside her. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; mumbled a soft, stumbling voice in an odd sing-song English. &#x201c;Sorry. It won&#x2019;t take long, I promise . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What wouldn&#x2019;t take long?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>Ama namin</i>,&#x201d; the voice whispered, in a rapid rush, &#x201c;<i>Sumsalangi Ka, Sambahin ang ngalan Mo</i> . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nina had heard the words before. She wasn&#x2019;t sure where or what they meant, but somewhere in the increasing darkness in her skull, small bubbles of memory rose and burst, small explosions of sensory impressions from the past. Heat. Buzzing flies. The stench of corpses. Distant, inconsolable weeping.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>Mapasaamin ang kaharian Mo</i> . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord&#x2019;s Prayer, she suddenly thought. That&#x2019;s the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer. But she couldn&#x2019;t remember in what language.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>Sundin ang loob Mo, dito sa lupa, para nang sa langit</i> . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why was someone kneeling beside her on the damp cold concrete and reciting the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Wait . . .&#x201d; she mumbled. Or tried to, but her tongue was as senseless as the rest of her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sorry, sorry,&#x201d; repeated the voice. &#x201c;Amen.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something dark and smelling of leather was placed across Nina&#x2019;s face, shutting out almost all the light. There was the sound of footsteps. An engine started, revving up angrily. The roar receded, then came nearer again. She could hear the sound of the tires rolling across the concrete, closer and closer. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> I should move, thought Nina. Crawl away. Do something. Save myself. </i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She couldn&#x2019;t. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But instead of the shattering contact with tires, undercarriage and engine power she had expected, there was the scream of metal against metal and a muffled crash. The sound of the engine ceased. Into the sudden stillness came the sound of an agitated voice with a Viborg accent.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What the <i>hell</i> are you doing? Watch out . . . Hey, I&#x2019;m talking to you!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Not to me</i>, thought Nina. <i>Not me. I don&#x2019;t have to answer.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other man, the apologetic one, apparently didn&#x2019;t mean to answer either. There was the sound of a rattling cough from an over-choked engine, then it settled once again into smooth efficiency, and with shrieking tires and screaming brakes a car&#x2014;<i>the</i> car, thought Nina&#x2014;left the Saint Mathias Mall. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What the . . .&#x201d; Hesitant steps came closer. &#x201c;Hello . . . Are you okay?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The external darkness disappeared when someone removed the leather jacket covering her face. Instead, an inner darkness moved in inexorably.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Fuck . . .&#x201d; she heard the Viborg voice say, an instant before she ceased to hear anything at all.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>S�ren Kirkegaard?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; S�ren automatically reached for his notebook. There was an official quality to the unfamiliar voice at the other end of the line that triggered his professional instincts. He had been a policeman for most of his adult life, and an intelligence officer in the Danish PET for nearly fifteen years, and he was quite used to meticulously registering the details of other people&#x2019;s disasters. But the next words shattered his expectations and froze his hand in midair above the pad.<br> &#x201c;Next of kin to Nina Borg?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Next of kin. Oh, God. She&#x2019;s dead. Only dead people have &#x201c;next of kin.&#x201d; </i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said hoarsely.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m calling from Viborg General Hospital. Nina Borg has been hospitalized here following an assault, and unfortunately she is unconscious.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not dead. It was not only the dead, he thought with relief; patients had &#x201c;next of kin&#x201d; as well. But&#x2014;assault? Unconscious? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; he asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know the circumstances,&#x201d; said the voice carefully. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a police matter. But I can tell you that she is on Ward A24, our ICU, under observation for a fractured skull. If you go to the ward&#x2019;s reception desk . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in Copenhagen,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll take me a few hours to get there.&#x201d; Tirstrup? Billund? No, Karup. Karup had to be the closest airport. Or was it faster simply to get in the car and drive? <i>Unconscious</i>. That could mean all kinds of things. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you tell me a little more now?&#x201d; he asked and thought of the long drive across Fyn, and then Jutland, or the unbearable wait in the airport, without knowing, without having any idea how . . . <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in administration,&#x201d; said the voice, not without a certain degree of compassion. &#x201c;Unfortunately, I only know what it says in the papers. Observation for a fractured skull.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Observation&#x2014;that sounded somewhat reassuring. If the skull had been seriously smashed, then it wouldn&#x2019;t just be &#x201c;observation,&#x201d; would it?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he remembered that he wasn&#x2019;t the only one with a stake in this. There were people who had a greater right, a closer relationship to Nina than he did. Children. Family.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Has her husband&#x2014;I mean her ex-husband been informed? And her mother?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nina was in Viborg because of her mother. Because of her mother&#x2019;s illness. In fact, why had they called him? Only now did he realize that this was odd. If Nina wasn&#x2019;t conscious, then how did they know . . . ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This is the only number I have been given,&#x201d; said the voice. &#x201c;It was in her diary under &#x2018;in case of emergency.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call the others,&#x201d; said S�ren.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>He called the ex-husband first. It took a little while to find the number, time he felt he could ill afford. His instincts clamored for him to throw himself behind the wheel and just drive. But Morten was the father of her children.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was an odd echo in the background of the call. Clattering steps, shouts, the shrill sound of sneakers squealing against a gym floor. Handball? Badminton?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S�ren explained. For several seconds, there was silence on the line, except for the sports backdrop.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh, damn it. Not again. What am I supposed to tell the children?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S�ren assumed it was a rhetorical question. He was amazed at the anger in Morten&#x2019;s voice, as if this was something Nina had done on purpose to hurt her family. But the key to that anger had to lie in the &#x201c;not again.&#x201d; It was Morten who had initiated the divorce. He was the one who could not live with Nina&#x2019;s involvement in other people&#x2019;s disasters and the danger in which she repeatedly put herself&#x2014;sometimes along with her family&#x2014;as a consequence of what her daughter called her &#x201c;save the world&#x201d; gene. In the end, Morten had felt that he had no choice but to rescue Ida and Anton from Nina&#x2019;s personal war zone.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t exactly do it on purpose,&#x201d; said S�ren.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Morten and did not sound particularly mollified. <br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s never on purpose. She just can&#x2019;t help herself.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on my way there,&#x201d; said S�ren and let an unspoken question hang in the air.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; said Morten. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s great that someone still has the energy. Tell her that she should call the children as soon as she is able.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you being a bit harsh?&#x201d; S�ren couldn&#x2019;t help asking.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Possibly. But it&#x2019;s . . . let me see . . . the fifth or the sixth time in the last few years, if you count a few episodes from the Coal-House Camp. She&#x2019;s been attacked, she&#x2019;s had radiation poisoning, someone took a shot at her . . . She was the reason my daughter was attacked and kidnapped and . . . and placed in a hole in the ground, in an oil tank where she could have been asphyxiated . . .&#x201d; Morten&#x2019;s voice had acquired a tremor, and S�ren sympathized. He remembered that particular episode more clearly than he liked, since he was the one who had pulled Ida out of that dark hole in the ground, out of what might otherwise have been a living grave. The expression in her eyes had stayed with him for days.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morten interrupted his tally with what was clearly a great effort. &#x201c;Just tell her to call,&#x201d; he then said. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t tell the children until she can speak to them herself.&#x201d; <br><br>Nina&#x2019;s mother was more compassionate, though her first reaction was almost identical: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh, no. Not again.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She apparently knew who S�ren was, so although he had never met her&#x2014;Nina and he had not proceded that far in their hesitant partnering&#x2014;Nina had at least told her mother that he existed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But at least &#x2018;under observation for a fractured skull&#x2019; isn&#x2019;t the same as a fractured skull.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Hanne Borg. &#x201c;I suppose not.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call as soon as I know more,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I can call the hospital myself,&#x201d; said Nina&#x2019;s mother. &#x201c;You just get going. And if you need a bed, I have a spare room.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn&#x2019;t <i>sound</i> sick, but then, no one said you had to sound like the final act of <i>La Traviata</i> just because you had been diagnosed with cancer.<br><br> Finally, he was free to leave. He chose the highway in the end; he didn&#x2019;t have patience for the alternative. And while kilometer after kilometer disappeared under the Hyundai&#x2019;s hood, he wondered what he should make of that &#x201c;next of kin.&#x201d; It was at once touching and surprising to him that she had thought of him in this way. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had &#x201c;dated&#x201d;&#x2014;he winced a bit at the adolescent connotations, but what else could you call it?&#x2014;yet had proceeded no further into the minefield of personal relations. He was not sure what she wanted with him. Sex, yes. Love? He couldn&#x2019;t quite tell. She didn&#x2019;t have as much as a toothbrush in his house in R�dovre and no one had so far mentioned cohabitation. Perhaps it was only now that it occurred to him that this was what he wanted&#x2014;completely and without reservations. To be a couple. Married or not, he didn&#x2019;t much care which, but to share a home, to live together, to obey and honor and love, until the last breath of life left his feeble failing body.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feeble. That was precisely the way he felt now, and perhaps the deeper reason he hadn&#x2019;t pushed harder than he had. He felt more mortal than usual, more decrepit. It was not just the bullet that had made a mess of his lungs and ribcage, and the first convalescence that had taken much longer than he had hoped. He had made it to his feet again, made it back into his chair as group leader in the PET. It had been a struggle, but he could manage. Or he thought so until . . .<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until Torben, at his most boss-like, had put S�ren out to grass, sent him home with orders not to return for at least three months. Anger, anger at the unfairness still rumbled inside him. How could Torben have betrayed him in that way?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hadn&#x2019;t told Nina. Wrongheaded masculine pride, perhaps. He would have to drop that now, he supposed. If they really were &#x201c;next of kin.&#x201d; And if he had to explain why he had been able to drop everything at a moment&#x2019;s notice to go to Viborg to sit by her bedside.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assaulted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pictured her slight, boyish figure, the dark hair cut so short that it followed the shape of her skull like a soft, auburn shadow. It probably didn&#x2019;t make much of a difference how long your hair was if someone decided to hit you in the head with a baseball bat, or whatever they had used. All the same, it seemed to him to make her extra vulnerable and the attack more brutal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who had done it? And why? Was it random, or was it because Nina was Nina? Both Morten and Hanne seemed automatically to assume the latter, but even stubborn and at times highly exasperating Red Cross nurses could be the victims of random violence. He had to speak to the local police. Find out what had happened, and how they were handling the case. The desire to act, to do something, was overwhelming. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He coaxed a few more miles per hour out of the Hyundai and changed lanes to pass a Polish long-haul. Adrenaline made his hands vibrate faintly against the steering wheel, and somewhere in his chest was a tight nervous pain that for once has nothing to do with the physical scarring.<br><br>He reached Viborg just shy of midnight. There had been an accident near Fredericia that backed up the traffic all the way across the Lillebaelt Bridge. The intensive care unit was dimly lit and oddly womb-like. There were no windows facing the outside world, only a glass wall separating it from the central observation point from which the output from all the various apparata in the ward was monitored. Sounds were faint and muffled, soft beeps and distant step...</p><h2>The Ice Beneath Her: A Novel (Hanne Lagerlind-Schon)</h2><p><b>Acclaimed Swedish author Camilla Grebe makes her solo American debut with a psychological thriller as cunning in its twists as it is captivating in its storytelling&#x2014;for fans of the celebrated crime fiction of Camilla L�ckberg, Jo Nesb�, Ruth Ware, and Fiona Barton.</b><br><br> Winter&#x2019;s chill has descended on Stockholm as police arrive at the scene of a shocking murder.

Her stone is simple, barely knee-high, in rough-hewn granite. We&#x2019;ve been talking for a while&#x2014;my mother and I&#x2014;about how hard it is to be a police officer in this city, where nobody gives a damn about anything but themselves. And&#x2014;perhaps more important&#x2014;how hard it is to live in that kind of city, in this kind of time.<br><br>I stomp wet snow off my sneakers and turn away from her headstone. It doesn&#x2019;t feel right to talk on the phone at her grave. The rolling hills of the Woodland Cemetery lay spread out before me. Mist hovers between the tops of tall pines, and beneath it the dark tree trunks shoot up out of the snow like exclamation marks, as if emphasizing life&#x2019;s transience. There&#x2019;s dripping from the treetops and from the gravestones. Meltwater runs over everything. It finds its way into my thin shoes, too, collecting around my toes like a wet reminder to buy those boots I have yet to allow myself. Somewhere in the distance I catch a glimpse of dark figures receding into the pine forest. Maybe they&#x2019;re here to light votive candles or place pine boughs.<br><br>Christmas will be here soon.<br><br>I take a few steps toward the neatly plowed footpath and throw a glance at the phone screen, even though I already know who it is. The feeling is unmistakable. A sinking, pounding sensation that I know all too well.<br><br>Before I answer, I turn back one last time to her headstone. Wave awkwardly and mumble something about coming back soon. It&#x2019;s unnecessary, of course&#x2014;she knows I always come back.<br><br>The road stretches out black and shining as I drive into the city. The brake lights of other cars glisten in front of me on the road, lighting the way. Thick drifts of dirty brown snow and squat, depressing, conformist buildings line the road to Stockholm. The occasional illuminated Christmas star brightens up a window, like a torch in the night. It&#x2019;s started snowing again. A rainy slush settles on the windshield, blurring all the edges, softening the landscape. The only sound is the rhythmic swish of the wipers married to the soft purr of the motor.<br><br>A murder.<br><br>Yet another murder.<br><br>Many years ago, back when I was still a rookie homicide detective, getting called to the scene of a murder always provoked a kind of exhilaration. Death was synonymous with a mystery that needed solving, like tangled yarn that needed unraveling. Back then I thought everything could be unraveled and explained. As long as you had the energy, the stamina, and knew which threads to pull and in what order. Reality was nothing more than a complex web of threads.<br><br>In short, it could be mastered, figured out.<br><br>Now I don&#x2019;t know anymore. Maybe I&#x2019;ve lost interest in the web itself, lost my intuition for which thread to pull. Over time, death has taken on new meaning. Mom, resting in the wet ground of the Woodland Cemetery. Annika, my sister, lying in the same cemetery not far away. And Dad, who&#x2019;s bent on drinking himself to death on the Costa del Sol, will be here soon enough. The crimes that come my way no longer feel as important. Sure, I can help figure out what happened. Put the inconceivable into words&#x2014;someone had their life taken from them&#x2014;and describe the events that led up to it. Maybe find the culprit, too, and in the best-case scenario, help to prosecute him. But the dead are still dead, aren&#x2019;t they? These days, I have difficulty finding meaning in what I do.<br><br>By the time I reach Roslagstull dusk is falling, and it occurs to me that it never really got light today. This day passed unnoticed through the same colorless December fog as yesterday and the day before. There&#x2019;s more traffic once I merge onto the E18 highway heading north. I pass by roadwork, and potholes shake the car so the Little Tree hanging from the rearview mirror jumps alarmingly.<br><br>Manfred calls again when I&#x2019;m driving past the university. Tells me it&#x2019;s a goddamn mess, some kind of bigwig is involved, and it would be great if I stopped taking so goddamn long and showed up already. I peer out into the cement-gray dusk, tell him to hold his horses, the road has more holes than Swiss cheese, and I&#x2019;ll bruise my balls if I drive any faster.<br><br>Manfred fires off his familiar, grunting laugh, like the snort of a pig. Or maybe I&#x2019;m being unfair: Manfred is fat; maybe that colors my view of his laugh, makes me think of a voluptuous grunting. Maybe his laugh sounds just like mine.<br><br>Maybe we all sound the same.<br><br>We&#x2019;ve been working together for more than ten years, Manfred and me. Year after year, we&#x2019;ve stood side by side at the autopsy table, interrogating witnesses, and meeting distraught relatives. Year after year, we&#x2019;ve taken on the bad guys and done our best to make the world a safer place. But have we, really? All those people slumbering in cold storage at Forensic Medicine in Solna are still dead and nothing will change that. Forever and ever. We are no more than society&#x2019;s cleaning crew, tying up loose ends after the fabric frays and the unthinkable has already happened.<br><br>Janet says I&#x2019;m depressed, but I don&#x2019;t trust Janet. Besides, I don&#x2019;t believe in depression. Because that&#x2019;s how it is: I don&#x2019;t believe in it. In my case, I&#x2019;ve just realized the true state of our existence, and I&#x2019;m looking soberly at life for the first time. Janet says that&#x2019;s a textbook response, that the depressed person isn&#x2019;t able to see beyond his own perceived misery. In return I tell her depression is one of the pharmaceutical industry&#x2019;s most profitable inventions, and I don&#x2019;t have the time or the desire to make obscenely rich pharmaceutical companies even richer. And if Janet wants to talk more about how I&#x2019;m feeling after that, I always hang up. After all, we broke up more than fifteen years ago; there&#x2019;s no need to discuss that kind of thing with her. That she happens to be the mother of my only child doesn&#x2019;t change that fact.<br><br>Albin, by the way, is the child we never should have had. Not because there&#x2019;s anything wrong with Albin&#x2014;he&#x2019;s a normal enough teenage boy: pimply, oversexed, and pathologically interested in computer games&#x2014;but because I truly wasn&#x2019;t ready to be a parent. In my darker moments (which are becoming more and more frequent over the years) I think she did it on purpose. Threw away her birth control pills and got pregnant as revenge for that thing with the wedding. Maybe that&#x2019;s the case. I&#x2019;ll never know, and it doesn&#x2019;t really matter now. Albin very much exists, and lives in comfort with his mother. We see each other sometimes, not often&#x2014;at Christmas and Midsummer and on his birthday. I think it&#x2019;s best for him if we don&#x2019;t have much contact. Otherwise, he&#x2019;d probably end up disappointed with me too.<br><br>Sometimes I think I should carry a picture of him in my wallet, like the other (real) parents. A clumsy school picture taken against a sepia-toned panel in a gym by a photographer whose dreams have led no further than the Farsta High School. But then I realize that wouldn&#x2019;t fool anyone, least of all myself. Parenthood is something you earn, I think. A right that comes from suffering sleepless nights, changing diapers, and all that other stuff you have to do. It has very little to do with genetics, the sperm I unknowingly donated fifteen years ago so Janet could fulfill her dream of being a mother.<br><br>I spot the house from a distance. Not because the white, boxy building stands out in any way in this exclusive suburb, but because it&#x2019;s surrounded by police cars. Blue lights flash across the snow, and the unmistakable white van of the forensic technicians is parked neatly not far away. I park at the bottom of the hill and walk the last stretch up toward the house. Greet the uniforms, flash my badge, and slip under the blue-and-white barrier tape fluttering gently in the breeze.<br><br>Manfred Olsson is standing at the front door. His huge body obscures most of the doorway as he raises a hand in greeting. He&#x2019;s wearing a tweed blazer with a bit of a pink silk scarf poking out of the breast pocket. His generous wool pants are tucked firmly into blue plastic shoe covers.<br><br>&#x201c;Goddamn, Lindgren. I thought you&#x2019;d never show up.&#x201d;<br><br>I meet his eyes. His small, impish peppercorn eyes are set deeply in his ruddy face. His thin ginger hair is combed neatly in a style that calls to mind an actor in a fifties movie. He looks more like an antiques dealer or a historian or sommelier than a police officer. In fact the last thing he looks like is a cop&#x2014;something he&#x2019;s undoubtedly aware of. I suspect it might just be a ploy, that he actually loves exaggerating his eccentric style in order to provoke more hidebound cops.<br><br>&#x201c;Like I said . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, yeah. Blame it on the traffic,&#x201d; Manfred says. &#x201c;I know how it is when you get hold of a good fucking porno. Hard to tear yourself away.&#x201d;<br><br>Manfred&#x2019;s rough language is in sharp contrast to his elaborate and conservative style of dress. He hands me a pair of shoe covers and gloves, and says in a quieter voice:<br><br>&#x201c;Listen. This is some truly fucked-up shit . . . Come on, see for yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>I put on the shoe covers and plastic gloves and step onto the transparent plastic plates that the technicians have placed seemingly at random in the hall. The smell of blood is so intense and nauseating that I almost retreat, even though I know it all too well. The pounding in my gut is growing stronger. Despite all the crime scenes I&#x2019;ve been at, all the corpses I&#x2019;ve seen, there&#x2019;s something about being in the proximity of cold, naked death that still makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Maybe it&#x2019;s the reality of how fast it can happen. How quickly a life can be extinguished. But then again sometimes it&#x2019;s the opposite&#x2014;the way a crime scene, or a body, bears witness to unbearably protracted agony.<br><br>I nod to the forensic technicians in white coveralls and look around the hall. It&#x2019;s noticeably anonymous, verging on austere. Or is it just very masculine? They&#x2019;re almost the same thing when it comes to interior design. White walls, gray floor. No sign of the personal belongings you would normally find in an entrance hall: coats, bags, or shoes. I step onto the next plastic square and peek into a kitchen. Black-lacquered kitchen cabinets, high gloss. An elliptical table with chairs around it that I recognize from some home decor magazine. Knives on parade along the wall. I note that none seem to be missing.<br><br>Manfred puts his hand on my arm.<br><br>&#x201c;Here. This way.&#x201d;<br><br>I continue down the hall on the plastic steps. Pass by a forensic technician equipped with a camera and notepad. A large bloodstain spreads out under the plastic. No, it&#x2019;s no bloodstain, it&#x2019;s a sea. A red, sticky sea of fresh blood that seems to cover this entire section of the hall, from wall to wall and farther down the stairs to the basement. From this sea there are tons of footprints in different sizes that lead toward the front door.<br><br>&#x201c;A hell of a lot of blood,&#x201d; Manfred mumbles, and steps forward with surprising agility, even though the plastic steps buckle under his weight. A numbered sign stands next to a bloody bundle of clothing. I catch a glimpse of a leg and a high-heeled black boot, and then the lower body of a woman. She&#x2019;s lying on her back with her head turned away from me. It takes a few seconds for me to realize she&#x2019;s been beheaded and that what I first mistook for a bundle of clothing is in fact a head lying on the floor. Or rather, it stands there, as if it grew from the floor.<br><br>Like a mushroom.<br><br>Manfred groans and sinks down on his haunches. I lean forward, taking in the macabre scene. Letting it in&#x2014;that&#x2019;s important. The natural reaction is to shrink back, look away from this terror, but as a homicide detective I have long since learned to suppress that reflex.<br><br>The woman&#x2019;s face and brown hair are clotted with blood. If I had to guess, which is a little difficult given the condition of the body, I&#x2019;d say she&#x2019;s around twenty-five. Her body is also soaked with blood, and I glimpse what look like deep wounds on the forearms. She&#x2019;s wearing a black skirt, black tights, and a gray sweater. Beneath her, soaked in blood, I glimpse a winter coat.<br><br>&#x201c;Fucking hell.&#x201d;<br><br>Manfred nods and strokes his stubble. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s been beheaded.&#x201d;<br><br>I nod. There&#x2019;s nothing to add to that statement. It&#x2019;s obvious that&#x2019;s exactly what happened. It requires a considerable strength, or at least laborious effort, to separate a head from its body. It says something about the perp. Exactly what I don&#x2019;t know yet, but it was certainly no cripple who did this. The killer was reasonably strong. Or very motivated.<br><br>&#x201c;Do we know who she is?&#x201d;<br><br>Manfred shakes his head. &#x201c;No. But we know who lives here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jesper Orre.&#x201d;<br><br>The name sounds familiar, in the way of a retired athlete or former politician. It rings a bell, but I can&#x2019;t remember where I&#x2019;ve heard it before.<br><br>&#x201c;Jesper Orre?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Jesper Orre. The CEO of Clothes&amp;More.&#x201d;<br><br>Then I remember. The controversial CEO of C&amp;M, Scandinavia&#x2019;s fastest-growing clothing chain. The man the media loves to hate.

They could name all the animals and plants across a landscape, identify the stars in the sky, and recite the history of their people. Yet today, most of us struggle to memorize more than a short poem.<br><br> Using traditional Aboriginal Australian song lines as a starting point, Dr. Lynne Kelly has since identified the powerful memory technique used by our ancestors and indigenous people around the world. In turn, she has then discovered that this ancient memory technique is the secret purpose behind the great prehistoric monuments like Stonehenge, which have puzzled archaeologists for so long.<br><br> The henges across northern Europe, the elaborate stone houses of New Mexico, huge animal shapes in Peru, the statues of Easter Island&#x2015;these all serve as the most effective memory system ever invented by humans. They allowed people in non-literate cultures to memorize the vast amounts of information they needed to survive. But how?<br><br> For the first time, Dr. Klly unlocks the secret of these monuments and their uses as "memory places" in her fascinating book. Additionally, <em>The Memory Code</em> also explains how we can use this ancient mnemonic technique to train our minds in the tradition of our forbearers.

But they provided my brothers and me with plenty of ammunition for fighting the neighboring boys across the creek. One of our jobs was to shoo the cows out of the corn patch, which was more exciting than it sounds. There were always two or three yearling bulls in the dairy herd, and when we wanted to get home quickly, we&#39;d each grab one by the tail. The bulls would light out for the barn, their feet hitting the ground about every two yards, and ours in proportion. But the really entrancing thing was the forest that surounded us: mountains filled with game, and trout streams loaded with fish.&#34; Jim&#39;s first book was &#34;Forest Patrol&#34;, based on the wilderness experiences of himself and his brother, a forest ranger. &#34;Big Red,&#34; &#34;Irish Red,&#34; and &#34;Outlaw Red&#34; are dog stories about Irish setters.*"Sure-fire combination of a boy and dog.

The effect might not be easy to see. There will be a small ripple where the stone breaks the surface and then a splash, muffled by the rush of the surrounding river. That&#x2019;s all.</p><p>Throw a stone into a lake. The effect will be not only visible but also far more lasting. The stone will disrupt the still waters. A circle will form where the stone hit the water, and in a flash that circle will multiply into another, then another. Before long the ripples caused by one plop will expand until they can be felt everywhere along the mirrored surface of the water. Only when the circles reach the shore will they stop and die out.</p><p>If a stone hits a river, the river will treat it as yet another commotion in its already tumultuous course. Nothing unusual. Nothing unmanageable.</p><p>If a stone hits a lake, however, the lake will never be the same again.</p><p>For forty years Ella Rubinstein&#x2019;s life had consisted of still waters&#x2014;a predictable sequence of habits, needs, and preferences. Though it was monotonous and ordinary in many ways, she had not found it tiresome. During the last twenty years, every wish she had, every person she befriended, and every decision she made was filtered through her marriage. Her husband, David, was a successful dentist who worked hard and made a lot of money. She had always known that they did not connect on any deep level, but connecting emotionally need not be a priority on a married couple&#x2019;s list, she thought, especially for a man and a woman who had been married for so long. There were more important things than passion and love in a marriage, such as understanding, affection, compassion, and that most godlike act a person could perform, forgiveness. Love was secondary to any of these. Unless, that is, one lived in novels or romantic movies, where the protagonists were always larger than life and their love nothing short of legend.</p><p>Ella&#x2019;s children topped her list of priorities. They had a beautiful daughter in college, Jeannette, and teenage twins, Orly and Avi. Also, they had a twelve-year-old golden retriever, Spirit, who had been Ella&#x2019;s walking buddy in the mornings and her cheeriest companion ever since he&#x2019;d been a puppy. Now he was old, overweight, completely deaf, and almost blind; Spirit&#x2019;s time was coming, but Ella preferred to think he would go on forever. Then again, that was how she was. She never confronted the death of anything, be it a habit, a phase, or a marriage, even when the end stood right in front of her, plain and inevitable.</p><p>The Rubinsteins lived in Northampton, Massachusetts, in a large Victorian house that needed some renovation but still was splendid, with five bedrooms, three baths, shiny hardwood floors, a three-car garage, French doors, and, best of all, an outdoor Jacuzzi. They had life insurance, car insurance, retirement plans, college savings plans, joint bank accounts, and, in addition to the house they lived in, two prestigious apartments: one in Boston, the other in Rhode Island. She and David had worked hard for all this. A big, busy house with children, elegant furniture, and the wafting scent of homemade pies might seem a clich� to some people, but to them it was the picture of an ideal life. They had built their marriage around this shared vision and had attained most, if not all, of their dreams.</p><p>On their last Valentine&#x2019;s Day, her husband had given her a heart-shaped diamond pendant and a card that read,</p><p></p><p>To my dear Ella,</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>A woman with a quiet manner, a generous heart, and the patience of a saint. Thank you for accepting me as I am. Thank you for being my wife.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Yours,</p><p>David</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ella had never confessed this to David, but reading his card had felt like reading an obituary. This is what they will write about me when I <i>die,</i> she had thought. And if they were sincere, they might also add this:</p><p><i>Building her whole life around her husband and children, Ella lacked any survival techniques to help her cope with life&#x2019;s hardships on her own. She was not the type to throw caution to the wind. Even changing her daily coffee brand was a major effort.</i></p><p>All of which is why no one, including Ella, could explain what was going on when she filed for divorce in the fall of 2008 after twenty years of marriage.</p><p>But there was a reason: love.</p><p>They did not live in the same city. Not even on the same continent. The two of them were not only miles apart but also as different as day and night. Their lifestyles were so dissimilar that it seemed impossible for them to bear each other&#x2019;s presence, never mind fall in love. But it happened. And it happened fast, so fast in fact that Ella had no time to realize what was happening and to be on guard, if one could ever be on guard against love.</p><p>Love came to Ella as suddenly and brusquely as if a stone had been hurled from out of nowhere into the tranquil pond of her life.</p><p><b>Ella</b></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>NORTHAMPTON, MAY 17, 2008</b></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>B</b>irds were singing outside her kitchen window on that balmy day in spring. Afterward Ella replayed the scene in her mind so many times that, rather than a fragment from the past, it felt like an ongoing moment still happening somewhere out there in the universe.</p><p>There they were, sitting around the table, having a late family lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Her husband was filling his plate with fried chicken legs, his favorite food. Avi was playing his knife and fork like drumsticks while his twin, Orly, was trying to calculate how many bites of which food she could eat so as not to ruin her diet of 650 calories a day. Jeannette, who was a freshman at Mount Holyoke College nearby, seemed lost in her thoughts as she spread cream cheese on another slice of bread. Also at the table sat Aunt Esther, who had stopped by to drop off one of her famous marble cakes and then stayed on for lunch. Ella had a lot of work to do afterward, but she was not ready to leave the table just yet. Lately they didn&#x2019;t have too many shared family meals, and she saw this as a golden chance for everyone to reconnect.</p><p>&#x201c;Esther, did Ella give you the good news?&#x201d; David asked suddenly. &#x201c;She found a great job.&#x201d;</p><p>Though Ella had graduated with a degree in English literature and loved fiction, she hadn&#x2019;t done much in the field after college, other than editing small pieces for women&#x2019;s magazines, attending a few book clubs, and occasionally writing book reviews for some local papers. That was all. There was a time when she&#x2019;d aspired to become a prominent book critic, but then she simply accepted the fact that life had carried her elsewhere, turning her into an industrious housewife with three kids and endless domestic responsibilities.</p><p>Not that she complained. Being the mother, the wife, the dog walker, and the housekeeper kept her busy enough. She didn&#x2019;t have to be a breadwinner on top of all these. Though none of her feminist friends from Smith College approved of her choice, she was satisfied to be a stay-at-home mom and grateful that she and her husband could afford it. Besides, she had never abandoned her passion for books and still considered herself a voracious reader.</p><p>A few years ago, things had begun to change. The children were growing up, and they made it clear that they didn&#x2019;t need her as much as they once had. Realizing that she had too much time to spare and no one to spend it with, Ella had considered how it might be to find a job. David had encouraged her, but though they kept talking and talking about it, she rarely pursued the opportunities that came her way, and when she did, potential employers were always looking for someone younger or more experienced. Afraid of being rejected over and over, she had simply let the subject drop.</p><p>Nevertheless, in May 2008 whatever obstacle had impeded her from finding a job all these years unexpectedly vanished. Two weeks shy of her fortieth birthday, she found herself working for a literary agency based in Boston. It was her husband who found her the job through one of his clients&#x2014;or perhaps through one of his mistresses.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s no big deal,&#x201d; Ella rushed to explain now. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m only a part-time reader for a literary agent.&#x201d;</p><p>But David seemed determined not to let her think too little of her new job. &#x201c;Come on, tell them it&#x2019;s a well-known agency,&#x201d; he urged, nudging her, and when she refused to comply, he heartily agreed with himself. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a prestigious place, Esther. You should see the other assistants! Girls and boys fresh out of the best colleges. Ella is the only one going back to work after being a housewife for years. Now, isn&#x2019;t she something?&#x201d;</p><p>Ella wondered if, deep inside, her husband felt guilty about keeping her away from a career, or else about cheating on her&#x2014;these being the only two explanations she could think of as to why he was now going overboard in his enthusiasm.</p><p>Still smiling, David concluded, &#x201c;This is what I call chutzpah. We&#x2019;re all proud of her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She is a prize. Always was,&#x201d; said Aunt Esther in a voice so sentimental that it sounded as if Ella had left the table and was gone for good.</p><p>They all gazed at her lovingly. Even Avi didn&#x2019;t make a cynical remark, and Orly for once seemed to care about something other than her looks. Ella forced herself to appreciate this moment of kindness, but she felt an overwhelming exhaustion that she had never experienced before. She secretly prayed for someone to change the subject.</p><p>Jeannette, her older daughter, must have heard the prayer, for she suddenly chimed in, &#x201c;I have some good news, too.&#x201d;</p><p>All heads turned toward her, faces beaming with expectation.</p><p>&#x201c;Scott and I have decided to get married,&#x201d; Jeannette announced. &#x201c;Oh, I know what you guys are going to say! That we haven&#x2019;t finished college yet and all that, but you&#x2019;ve got to understand, we both feel...</p></p><h2>Beartown: A Novel</h2><p><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY: <i>LibraryReads </i></b><b>�</b><b><i> BookBrowse </i></b><b>� </b><b><i>Goodreads </i></b><br> <br><b>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll love this engrossing novel.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>People</i></b><br> <br><b>The bestselling author of<i> A Man Called Ove</i> returns with a dazzling, profound novel about a small town with a big dream&#x2014;and the price required to make it come true.</b><br><br>People say Beartown is finished. A tiny community nestled deep in the forest, it is slowly losing ground to the ever-encroaching trees. But down by the lake stands an old ice rink, built generations ago by the working men who founded this town. And in that ice rink is the reason people in Beartown believe tomorrow will be better than today. Their junior ice hockey team is about to compete in the national semi-finals, and they actually have a shot at winning. All the hopes and dreams of this place now rest on the shoulders of a handful of teenage boys.<br> <br>Being responsible for the hopes of an entire town is a heavy burden, and the semi-final match is the catalyst for a violent act that will leave a young girl traumatized and a town in turmoil. Accusations are made and, like ripples on a pond, they travel through all of Beartown, leaving no resident unaffected.<br> <br><i>Beartown</i> explores the hopes that bring a small community together, the secrets that tear it apart, and the courage it takes for an individual to go against the grain.

There are scenes that bring tears, scenes of gut-wrenching despair, and moments of sly humor. . .Like <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, this is about more than youth sports; it's part coming-of-age novel, part study of moral failure, and finally a chronicle of groupthink in which an unlikely hero steps forward to save more than one person from self-destruction.

However, the book is at least as valuable for its detailed account of the history of motorless planes from the early 19th-century experiments of Sir George Cayley to the new, high-tech PW-5 Smyk that will be used when soaring becomes on Olympic sport in 2000. In specific but nonmathematical terms, Schmidt explains Bernoulli's principle and other aerodynamic effects, then describes the use of gliders in wartime, the development of gliding as a competitive sport, and the continuing refinements in design and materials. The models, all but one of which are based on real gliders, are not for novices, as even the simplest has 10 pieces and the author warns that precise cutting and adjustments are required for good results. Nonetheless, Schmidt makes the construction as easy as possible with plenty of tips about safety and technique. He also instructs readers to photocopy the pages, and not cut them out. For its historical background, consider this as a companion to John Bringhurst's Planes, Jets and Helicopters (Tab Books, 1993).AJohn Peters, New York Public Library<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 6^-12. Readers familiar with Schmidt's previous books on paper airplanes who are ready to build more-sophisticated flying paper models will definitely want to see this book. Besides providing patterns for 16 gliders (all but one are models of actual gliders), Schmidt supplies a history of soaring flight and glider development, instructs readers in the basic principles of aerodynamics, and describes how to test and launch the paper gliders. Pattern pieces, which can be photocopied and cut from card stock, are clearly labeled, and the detailed step-by-step instructions leave little room for error. A brief history of each glider accompanies a full-color photograph of the completed model. A glossary of aviation terms is appended. <i>Chris Sherman</i></p><h2>Normandy: The Landings to the Liberation of Paris</h2><p><p> The Allied landings on the coast of Normandy on June 6, 1944, have assumed legendary status in the annals of World War II. But in overly romanticizing D-day, Olivier Wieviorka argues, we have lost sight of the full picture. <i>Normandy</i> offers a balanced, complete account that reveals the successes and weaknesses of the titanic enterprise. </p><p> In addition to describing the landings with precision and drama, Wieviorka covers the planning and diplomatic background, Allied relationships, German defensive preparations, morale of the armies, economics and logistics, political and military leaders, and civilians&#x2019; and soldiers&#x2019; experience of the fighting. Surprisingly, the landing itself was not the slaughter the general staff expected. The greater battle for Normandy&#x2014;waged on farmland whose infamous hedgerows, the bocage, created formidable obstacles&#x2014;took a severe toll not only in lives lost, but on the survivors who experienced this grueling ordeal. </p><p> D-day, Wieviorka notes, was a striking accomplishment, but it was war, violent and cruel. Errors, desertions, rivalries, psychological trauma, self-serving motives, thefts, and rapes were all part of the story. Rather than diminishing the Allied achievement, this candid book underscores the price of victory and acknowledges the British, American, and Canadian soldiers who dashed onto the Normandy beaches not as demigods, but as young men. </p></p><p>Olivier Wieviorka is Professor of History at the �cole Normale Sup�rieure de Cachan.This remarkable work rests on a series of sharp and convincing analyses worthy of a latter-day Thucydides. There isn't any aspect of the colossal and risky enterprise that Wieviorka has neglected. He is as impressive in interpreting the political calculations and motivations of the leaders as in describing the battles and evaluating the gaps between military plans and achievements. His discussion of the psychological trauma of the Allied soldiers is both moving and essential. On a topic on which so much has been written, Wieviorka has come as close to a definitive treatment as one can expect. <br> --Stanley Hoffmann, Harvard University<br><br>Accounts of the Normandy campaign are not in short supply, but this one from a French military historian delivers an energetic, mildly revisionist overview...This is an engrossing history of the Normandy campaign.

Miller (<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> 2008-06-06)<br><br>Engaging and well written, French historian Wieviorka's analysis of the Normandy campaign superbly illustrates the political and military complexities of coalition warfare. Perhaps more striking, this cogent narrative of the 1944 Anglo-American amphibious operation and subsequent ground campaign in northwest France powerfully demonstrates the importance of logistics in modern mechanized warfare, the critical role of intelligence and deception in Allied success, and the limitations of airpower in ground operations...Wieviorka's fresh perspective is thoroughly thought-provoking and a welcome addition to the historiography.<br> --D.

Award-winning author Albert Marrin illustrates the hardships and significance of a man's beliefs and its affects on our nation in a way that all ages can comprehend.</p><p>ALBERT MARRIN is the author of numerous highly regarded nonfiction books for young readers, including the National Book Award Finalist <i>Flesh and Blood So Cheap: The Triangle Fire and Its Legacy</i>, <i>A Volcano Beneath the Snow: John Brown's War on Slavery</i>, and <i>Black Gold: The Story of Oil in Our Lives</i>.

Named Thomas, he was the only surviving child of Joseph Pain and his wife, Frances. (In his twenties, Thomas added the e to his last name; to avoid confusion, we will always use Paine.) A daughter born the following year soon died, a common tragedy, since half the infants born in Europe died before their second year because of poor diet and disease.<br><br> Frances was eleven years older than her husband and nearly forty when she gave birth to Thomas. Neighbors had a low opinion of her. She was, they recalled, &#x201c;a woman of sour temper,&#x201d; sharp-tongued, petty, and quick to take offense. Most likely, this was due to regrets at having married &#x201c;beneath her station,&#x201d; that is, lower on the social scale than her own family. One&#x2019;s place in eighteenth-century society depended upon family background, wealth, and religion. The daughter of a successful attorney, Frances belonged to the Church of England, the established, or official, state church. Only its members could sit on the throne, hold public office, or have a government job.1<br><br> Frances&#x2019;s husband was a gentle, easygoing man, a corset maker by trade. To give them narrow waists, fashionable ladies wore linen corsets stiffened with whalebone, laced so tightly that they made breathing hard. A skilled artisan, Joseph carefully sewed the polished strips of whalebone into place. He was also a Quaker, one of several Protestant groups called nonconformists because they did not follow, or conform to, the teachings of the Church of England. Besides Quakers (also known as the Society of Friends), nonconformists included Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterians. Thomas attended both his parents&#x2019; places of worship.<br><br> Whatever their religion, English people believed their country the most advanced on earth. They took pride in their overseas colonies, in the Royal Navy--the world&#x2019;s largest--and, most of all, in the British constitution. This is not a written document like the United States Constitution, but all the laws and customs relating to the monarch and Parliament, the national legislature. The constitution guaranteed rights unknown anywhere outside England and her American colonies: trial by jury, free speech, and habeas corpus, Latin for &#x201c;present the body.&#x201d; This meant that a person arrested for a crime must be either formally charged and put on trial within a short time or released. Elsewhere in Europe, the authorities could keep suspects in jail for years without pressing charges or giving them their day in court. France, Spain, Italy, Russia, and some German states allowed torture to gain evidence or a confession. Unable to bear the pain, people often confessed to crimes they did not commit.<br><br> The British constitution rests on a central principle: nobody is above the law. The idea that there is one law for everyone, no matter their station in life, originated in the Middle Ages. In June 1215, the nobility forced King John, who had ruled pretty much as he liked, to sign the Magna Carta, or Great Charter. His Majesty agreed (Article 39) that &#x201c;no free person shall be taken or imprisoned or dispossessed, or outlawed, or banished, or in any way destroyed . . . except by the legal judgment of his peers or the law of the land.&#x201d; Kings learned that they broke the law at their peril. For example, King Charles I was publicly tried and beheaded in 1649, and King James II was driven out of the country for &#x201c;high crimes and misdemeanors&#x201d; in 1688.<br><br> The rule of law, however, did not mean political, social, or economic equality. Far from it. In young Thomas Paine&#x2019;s day, government was of, by, and for a few thousand wealthy families. The king, nobility, leading landlords, lawyers, merchants, and bankers controlled every aspect of public life. One needed a certain amount of property to vote or run for office. For example, Thetford, a town of two thousand, had only thirty-one qualified voters. This meant that a tiny minority of men, and no women, had a voice in making the laws. (Women were thought to lack the intelligence to make important decisions.) Wealthy men voted other wealthy men, or their own followers, into Parliament. The king, however, was the wealthiest person in the realm. So His Majesty usually got the laws he wanted by offering members &#x201c;golden pills&#x201d;--that is, government posts with grand titles, big salaries, and little if any work to do.<br><br> England&#x2019;s wealthy saw themselves as a race apart, naturally superior to everyone else. Inequality, supposedly, was God&#x2019;s law, meant to keep the lowly in their place. As Samuel Johnson, among the greatest English writers of his day, declared: &#x201c;Mankind are happier in a state of inequality and subordination.&#x201d; The lot of those &#x201c;common wretches that crawl upon the earth,&#x201d; others said, was &#x201c;to be born and eat and sleep and die, and be forgotten.&#x201d;2<br><br> A familiar jingle went:<br><br> It is a sin<br><br> To steal a pin.<br><br> Parents drilled this into their children&#x2019;s heads, for anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear knew that almost any misdeed could cost you your life.3<br><br> Eighteenth-century England was a cruel place, and life cheap. Savage laws protected property. When Thomas was a boy, some 250 offenses carried the death penalty. These ranged from high treason and murder to burglary, arson, rape, highway robbery, picking pockets, counterfeiting, and fishing or hunting on private estates.<br><br> Justice was truly blind, as the law made no distinction between young and old, between serious and petty crimes. Newspapers routinely reported executions that would be unthinkable in any civilized country today. We read, for example, of a boy of ten hanged for stealing a penknife. A hungry seven-year-old girl went to the gallows for snatching a petticoat, and a fourteen-year-old girl for taking a handkerchief from a shop. Afterward, an official announcement read: &#x201c;Let children beware of committing crimes, for their youth will not always save them.&#x201d; All executions were carried out in public, before large audiences, as warnings to would-be offenders.4<br><br> Until 1789, English women were strangled and their bodies burned at the stake for killing their husbands, even in self-defense. This law, a judge explained, was &#x201c;founded on a well-known part of the Christian religion which says, &#x2018;That wives should be obedient to their husbands in all things.&#x2019; &#x201d; Nor could someone charged with &#x201c;self-murder&#x201d;--that is, suicide--escape the gallows. The Gentleman&#x2019;s Magazine described how an angry crowd dug up a suicide&#x2019;s body, &#x201c;dragged his guts about the highway, poked his eyes out, and broke almost all his bones.&#x201d; Whipping and branding on the cheek with a red-hot iron punished non-death-penalty offenses, such as loitering or begging in forbidden places. If you owed money to a merchant, he could have you put in debtors&#x2019; prison until a relative or friend paid up. If not, you rotted in a damp, dark, dirty dungeon.5<br><br> Thomas saw the law&#x2019;s cruelty with his own eyes. His cottage stood alongside the main road, with a clear view of Gallows Hill, a bare chalk ridge used for hangings. The youngster often peered from a window as the condemned shuffled past in chains. Afterward, he watched their bodies outlined against the sky, swinging back and forth in the breeze. They swung for an hour to make sure they were dead and as a lesson to children about the &#x201c;wages of sin.&#x201d;<br> 1. Hawke, Paine, 8.<br><br> 2.

They live in Salt Lake City, Utah.In this clever companion picture book to their hilarious etiquette guide, It's a Spoon, Not a Shovel, the Buehners use wit and very punny humor to tackle the issue of ethics for children. The multiple-choice format here translates into more of a spirited guessing game than a classroom-style quiz. On each spread one or more animal characters faces an ethical dilemma (should Ima Scalebody the fish cheat on her test? Should Howie Hogg clean up the toys he took out?). Readers are encouraged to assess the situation and choose a suitable (and usually obvious) answer from three selections. As one of the many visual bonuses in this volume, the letter of the correct response is hidden somewhere in Mark Buehner's illustration. The artist's passion for visual surprise doesn't end there: he has also concealed bumblebees, cats, rabbits and dinosaurs, among other things, in each of his lush and expressive oil-and-acrylic paintings. From a school of fish in an underwater classroom to rats in a cafeteria, the artist tweaks familiar settings by populating them with his own gently anthropomorphic animal kingdom. Caralyn Buehner's snappy, alliterative text makes for an exuberant read-aloud, perfect for sharing between parent and child. Grown-ups will guffaw over such aptly named critters as the flies Buzzer and Annoya McFly, and rats Diseasa and Fungusto.

He is the author of Morality and Social Class in Eighteenth-Century French Literature and Painting; Jane Austen and the French Revolution; and Jacques-Louis David, Revolutionary Artist: Art, Politics, and the French Revolution.</p>Focusing on the period after the fall of Robespierre, Lajer-Burcharth (humanities, Harvard) reframes David's art in relation to gender tensions within French society at the time and within the artist's vision of himself. The methodologies of gender studies and semiotics are the focus of her argument, which sacrifices traditional art historical analysis. The author demonstrates how revolutionary dress and the stresses and losses it implied were reflected in the instability of David's art and his place as a revolutionary artist in French society. While trying to offer a new perspective on David and on visual representation during this period of French history, Lajer-Burcharth often looses her focus by cloaking David and his art in literary theory and opaque jargon. Recommended only for art libraries that support graduate programs in art history. While concentrating on the same time period, Roberts examines David and Jean-Louis Prieur, the most popular illustrator of the period, within a post-Marxist framework. Roberts first defines the Revolution in the theoretical terms of J?rgen Habermas's bourgeois public sphere, which is separate from the political sphere of the state. He also discusses Roger Chartier's idea of the division of the educated elite from the masses during the French Revolution. With these theoretical underpinnings, the author examines Prieur and David, who in their art reflected the concerns of both the plebeian "peuple" and the educated "public" of the salons. A detailed historical account of the key moments of the Revolution is included and related to the works of both men. This scholarly study is recommended only for libraries that support graduate programs in art or French history.<br><i>-Sandra Rothenberg, Framingham State Coll.

Anita Blake is an &#34;animator&#34; - a profession that involves raising the dead for a living. She is also known as a fearsome hunter of criminal vampires, and she moonlights by investigating cases that are far too much for &#34;conventional&#34; police. But as Anita gains the attention of the vampire masters in her hometown of St. Louis, she also risks revealing an intriguing secret about herself - the source of her unusual strength and power. Watch as Anita goes up against fierce obstacles and is forced to make tough choices. What price will Anita pay in order to save her friend&#39;s life and solve the Vampire Murders?

Collects Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter: Guilty Pleasures #1-12.</p><p></p><h2>The Enlightened Despots: Frederick the Great and Prussia, Napoleon and Europe (Imperial Visions Series: The Rise and Fall of Empires)</h2><p>From its earliest beginnings thousands of years ago, the course of man&#39;s progress has been measured by his empires. Large, dynamic flows of power, people, and culture that merge, thrive, then break apart - the pieces only to merge again in a new configuration, the process to be repeated. Through pictures and words, &#34;Empires: Their Rise and Fall&#34; brings the reader face to face with many of the world&#39;s greatest empires. Full-color photographs are combined with an absorbing narrative in a lively historical account of each empire and an examination of the period&#39;s most enduring cultural achievements. This volume in the series focuses on Frederick the Great and Prussia, and Napoleon and Europe, comparing and contrasting these two great rulers who represented both the technocratic and the arbitrary traditions of kingship. Frederick the Great of Prussia (1712-1786) and Napoleon Bonaparte of France (1769-1821) shared a similar passion for the army and displayed remarkable military abilities that won them dominant positions in Europe. They also shared an unwavering devotion to long hours of official drudgery, overseeing every aspect of their rapidly growing administrations. Both men read widely, particularly in the practical literature applicable to day-to-day affairs: law, finance, trade, military science, and politics. Neither tolerated political opposition. The result was the creation of superb military machines amply supported by the full resources of the state. Both Frederick and Napoleon launched campaigns that brought glory to themselves and to the state - and untold misery to soldiers and taxpayers. Sober and practical in method but ambitious in aim, the Enlightened Despots enjoyed absolute power that they used to build or destroy their states according to whim and temperament.</p><p></p><h2>Best Christmas Book Ever</h2><p>Childrens illustrated story includes craft and game ideas.</p><p>Born in Boston in 1919, Richard Scarry&#39;s drawing talent led him to study at the Boston Museum School.

Weekly . A series of essays on religion and ritual leads Ventura to reflect on the universal, urgent traumas of adolescence; much of popular culture, he suggests, engages this darkness, and he posits "an irresistible collective need for endarkenment." A New York-born Los Angeleno with an eye for dislocation, Ventura surveys Las Vegas--a place where you can do anything but which also has the highest teen suicide rate in the country--and concludes that the weirdest thing is how we take that city's weirdness for granted. His anti-Gulf War columns capture the cultural longing behind the jingoism that was rampant then, suggesting that the left fails to grasp the collective American psyche and its sense of shame over failure. A more-or-less reformed alcoholic, Ventura resists therapeutic cant; rather than renounce drinking, he has decided to be more careful, but also to learn "when to risk the immoderate." He is a worthy, if quirky, companion. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>In Search of God: With Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross, Therese of Lisieux, Edith Stein</h2><p>Some of the most popular contemporary authors present the gospel message applied to daily living for Christians in today&#39;s society.</p><p></p><h2>War in The Pacific: Volume 4 The Southwest Pacific Area (War in The Pacific, Volume 4)</h2><p>by Jerome T.

With enchanting illustrations by Milo Winter, this treasury contains the most popular of Aesop's moral stories: &#x201c;The Hare and the Tortoise,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Fox and the Grapes,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse,&#x201d; and many more!</p><p>Aesop (620-560 BC) was a slave in ancient Greece who is known only for the genre of fables that are ascribed to him.<b>From D. L Asliman's Introduction to <i>Aesop's Fables</i></b><p> Don&#x2019;t count your chickens before they are hatched!&#x201d; He is a wolf in sheep&#x2019;s clothing.&#x201d; She has a sour-grapes attitude.&#x201d; They are killing the goose that laid the golden eggs.&#x201d; He demands the lion&#x2019;s share.&#x201d; Don&#x2019;t be like the boy who called wolf!&#x2019;&#x201d; These expressions are so much a part of our everyday language and culture that they seem to have been with us forever, and that is almost the case, for the fables that produced these proverbial sayings are indeed even older than (to name but three) the modern English, French, and German languages where today they are so much at home. The fables behind these sayings are those of arguably the most famous storyteller of all time, the legendary Aesop. Who was the man who created these timeless literary gems?</p><b>The Man Aesop</b><p>Aesop (sometimes spelled �sop, �sopus, Esop, Esope, or using the Greek form of his name Aisopos) has been known in history and in legend since the fifth century b.c., or earlier, as a gifted Greek storyteller and the author of the world&#x2019;s best-known collection of fables. However, it cannot be proven with any degree of certainty that he existed as a real person. Most modern scholars believe that Aesop was instead a name invented, already in antiquity, to provide attribution for a body of oral tales whose true authors were a number of anonymous storytellers. Martin Luther expressed this view some 500 years ago: Attributing these stories to Aesop is, in my opinion, itself a fiction. Perhaps there has never been on earth a man by the name of Aesop&#x201d; (quoted in Jacobs, <i>History of the Aesopic Fabl</i>, p. 15; see For Further Reading&#x201d;).</p><p>Although it is possible that there was indeed a gifted Greek storyteller by the name of Aesop, his reputation expanded to legendary proportions in the decades and centuries following his death, and with time many more stories and deeds were credited to him than he could have composed and performed. Supporting this view, many of the earliest references to the stories of Aesop refer to Aesopic (or Aesopian) fables rather than Aesop&#x2019;s fables. In other words, Aesopic, an adjective, describes a kind of story and a literary tradition but does not claim to identify a specific author.</p><p>One thing is certain: Aesop, if he existed at all, did not leave behind a collection of written fables. His reputation is that of an oral storyteller, not an author of written literature. The oldest references to his fables refer to tales memorized and retold, not written and read. For example, from Aristophanes&#x2019;s comedy <i>Wasps</i> (written in 422 b.c.) we learn that telling anecdotes and comic stories in the style of Aesop was common entertainment at banquets in ancient Athens. More seriously, in 360 b.c. Plato recorded in his dialog <i>Phaedo</i> (section 61b) that Socrates, under sentence of death in prison, diverted himself by reformulating some of Aesop&#x2019;s fables. Plato&#x2019;s Phaedo quotes Socrates himself: I took some fables of Aesop, which I had ready at hand and knew, and turned them into verse.&#x201d; The doomed philosopher did not have a book or manuscript of Aesop&#x2019;s fables in prison with him, if such a book or manuscript even existed at the time. He knew the fables from memory, as did the partygoers in Aristophanes&#x2019;s comedy.</p><p>The most frequently cited ancient reference to the man Aesop is found in the <i>History</i> of the Greco-Persian Wars written by the Greek historian Herodotus about 425 b.c. Here we learn that Aesop, the fable writer, was a slave of Iadmon, son of Hephaestopolis, a Samian, and that Iadmon&#x2019;s grandson (also named Iadmon) claimed and received compensation for the murder of Aesop. If this account is true, Aesop would have lived during the sixth century b.c. Apart from this sketchy biography, Herodotus recorded essentially no additional details about the fable writer.</p><p>However, later Greek and Roman writers were not so reticent. One body of literature is particularly relevant in this regard. Usually referred to as <i>The Life of Aesop</i>, this work has survived in a number of medieval manuscripts by different anonymous compilers and is based on earlier accounts, now lost. The statements about Aesop&#x2019;s life history contained in the different versions of this work often contradict one another, or they are so miraculous and fantastic as to be unbelievable by modern standards.</p><p>The ultimate source of these accounts is undoubtedly folklore: anonymous legends told and retold by generations of oral storytellers. <i>The Life of Aesop</i> is today generally held to be fiction, but as is the case with many legends, there could be at least a kernel of truth in one or more of the episodes. The following biographical outline has been gleaned from different versions of <i>The Life of Aesop</i>, most prominently the accounts published by Lloyd W. Daly in his <i>Aesop without Morals</i> (pp. 31 90) and the <i>Everyman&#x2019;s Library</i> version of <i>Aesop: Fables</i> (pp. 17 45).</p><p>Aesop was born a slave, or possibly was captured into slavery at an early age. His birthplace is variously stated as Thrace, Phrygia, Ethiopia, Samos, Athens, or Sardis. He was dark-skinned. In fact, it is said that his name was derived from <i>Aethiop</i> (Ethiopian). He was physically deformed: a hunchback, pot belly, misshapen head, snub nose, and bandy legs are often mentioned. Although in his early years he suffered from a serious speech impediment, or according to some the inability to speak at all, he was cured through the intervention of a deity and became a gifted orator, especially skillful at incorporating fables into his speeches.</p><p>As a young man Aesop was transported by a slave trader to Ephesus (in modern Turkey). Because of his grotesque appearance, no one there would buy him, so he was taken to the island of Samos, where he was examined by Xanthus, identified in the manuscripts as an eminent philosopher,&#x201d; but a person whose existence cannot be verified historically. At first repulsed by Aesop&#x2019;s appearance, Xanthus changed his mind when the slave proclaimed, A philosopher should value a man for his mind, not for his body.&#x201d; Impressed with Aesop&#x2019;s astuteness, Xanthus purchased him as a manservant for his wife.</p><p>Aesop soon proved himself to be an irreverent and sarcastic trickster with a clever retort for every occasion. The following episode is typical of many others illustrating how Aesop&#x2019;s quick wit saved him from punishment, sometimes deserved, sometimes not: Xanthus, wanting to know what fate awaited him on a particular day, sent Aesop to see if any crows were outside the door. According to popular belief, two crows would portend good fortune, whereas a single crow would be an omen of bad luck. Aesop saw a pair of crows and reported this to his master, who then set forth with good cheer. Upon opening the door, Xanthus saw only a single crow, for one of them had flown away, and he angrily turned on his slave for having tricked him into beginning a dangerous venture. You shall be whipped for this!&#x201d; said Xanthus, and while Aesop was being readied for his punishment a messenger arrived at the door with an invitation for Xanthus to dine with his friends. Your omens have no meaning!&#x201d; cried Aesop. I saw the auspicious pair of crows, yet I am about to be beaten like a dog, whereas you saw the ominous single crow, and you are about to make merry with your friends.&#x201d; Perceiving the irony and the wisdom of this observation, Xanthus released Aesop and spared him the threatened punishment.</p><p>Aesop&#x2019;s cleverness extended from word to deed. An unrepentant trickster, his pranks ranged from tricking his fellow slaves into carrying the heavier burdens to seducing his master&#x2019;s wife with her unwitting husband&#x2019;s apparent blessing. His tricks often were masked by feigned stupidity on his part, which has led commentators to compare him to the German Till Eulenspiegel and the Turkish Nasreddin Hoca, two of the world&#x2019;s most rascally but beloved tricksters.</p><p>Aesop&#x2019;s legendary wisdom and shrewdness sometimes moved into the realm of the supernatural. He could solve seemingly impossible riddles and conundrums, foretell the future with uncanny accuracy, and unerringly discover hidden treasures. A master of human psychology, he understood what motivated people to act, and used this knowledge to manipulate them to his advantage. As his life progressed he moved to ever greater venues: from a trickster in a slave&#x2019;s workroom to a lecturer in a philosopher&#x2019;s auditorium to a diplomat and councilor in the courts of governors and kings.</p><p>With time his cunning, wisdom, and oratory skills brought him freedom from slavery, but in the end they cost him his life. At Delphi the citizens, offended by his lack of respect for their aristocracy and for their principal deity Apollo, planted a golden cup in his baggage, then accused him of temple theft.</p><p>Sentenced to die by being thrown over a cliff, Aesop pleaded his case with a series of fables, one of which was the story of The Mouse, the Frog, and the Hawk&#x201d; (no. 67 in the present collection). In this tale a frog and a mouse go swimming together in a pool with their feet tied together, but the mouse drowns. The frog, burdened by the dead mouse, is now an easy prey for a hawk, which forthwith captures and devours him.</p><p>Aesop compared himself to the mouse and the Delphians to the frog. You may kill me,&#x201d; he predicted, but my unjust death will bring you great misfortune.&#x201d; Aesop was executed near Delphi, and his dire prediction came true. Shortly after his death the region was visited with famine, pestilence, and warfare. The Delphians consulted the Oracle of Apollo as to the source of these calamities, and they received the answer that they were to make amends for the unjust death of Aesop. Accordingly they built there a pyramid in his honor.<br></p></p><h2>3-Minute Devotions for Moms of Little Ones</h2><p><b>God Loves Mommies of Littles!</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Written especially for moms of infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, this delightful devotional packs a powerful dose of comfort, encouragement, and inspiration into just-right-sized readings for your heart, Mom!<br> &nbsp;<br> Minute 1: scripture to meditate on;<br> Minute 2: a short devotional reading;<br> Minute 3: a prayer to jump-start a conversation with God.<br> &nbsp;<br> Each devotional reading will give you the encouragement and spiritual boost your heart desires&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s the ideal way for you to begin or end your day.

Is BPA dangerous or just a victim of unforgiving media hype? Is organic better? Dr. Joe questions the reliability and motives of &#x201c;experts&#x201d; in this easy-to-understand yet critical look at what&#x2019;s fact and what&#x2019;s plain nonsense. </p></p><p><b>Dr. Joe Schwarcz </b>is director of McGill University&#x2019;s Office for Science and Society, dedicated to demystifying science and separating sense from nonsense. He is a popular lecturer, both to students and to the larger public. He hosts The Dr. Joe Show on Montreal radio and is the author of over a dozen bestselling titles. Dr. Joe lives in Montreal, Quebec.<b>Introduction</b> <br>�Is that a fact?&#x201d; �They say that . . .&#x201d; �I heard that . . .&#x201d; Just listen in on some conversations around the water cooler and it won&#x2019;t be long before one of these phrases rings out. After all, this is the Communication Age. We are connected through cellphones, radio, TV, and of course the web. We talk, we tweet, we link, we text, we Facebook. We are informed. But in many cases, unfortunately, also misinformed. <br> <br>We suffer from information overload. Just Google a subject and within a second you can be flooded with a million references. It is therefore more important than ever to be able to analyze those references and be able to separate sense from nonsense. And that&#x2019;s where learning comes in. Information has to be scrutinized in the light of what is already known. But learning must be coupled with critical thinking. Confucius said it very well: �Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.&#x201d; <br> <br>The University of Google is well stocked with information, but its students are left to flounder when it comes to determining whether that information is reliable. Accounts of miraculous cancer cures, the rants of anti-vaccine activists, the exploits of fake psychics and the claims of various alternative healers may sound very seductive but stand to lose their luster in the light of scientific education. It would, however, be incorrect to suggest that education is the vaccine against folly. The annals of history are replete with examples of educated people who have succumbed to nonsense. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, a physician by training, believed in fairies and in communicating with the dead. Curiously, he was the creator of Sherlock Holmes who was a logician extraordinaire and eschewed such silliness. <br> <br>Indeed it was Holmes who reminded us that �It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts.&#x201d; These days, those of us who follow Holmes&#x2019; dictum and put evidence-based science on a pedestal, often get criticized for challenging claims we consider to be unscientific. �They laughed at Galileo,&#x201d; the promoters of such claims say, �and at Columbus, and at the Wright Brothers.&#x201d; But, as Carl Sagan pointed out, the fact that some geniuses were laughed at does not imply that all who are laughed at are geniuses. They also laughed at Bozo the Clown. <br> <br>Our best bet to differentiate the Bozos from the prospective Galileos is to push for more science education at all levels with a strong emphasis on the importance of critical thinking. Furthermore, it should be realized that when it comes to separating sense from nonsense, mental prowess is not enough. Benjamin Franklin was right on when he opined that �genius without education is like silver in a mine.&#x201d; Indeed, the value is there, but the silver is not of much use until you extract it. But how do you go about this extraction? How do we know who is right and who is wrong? How do I know what I claim to know? Actually, that is a question I had to contemplate recently when a student innocently asked me, �And how do you know that?&#x201d; <br> <br>I had just finished a lecture on toxicology in which I had described the problem of cyanide poisoning by cassava, a tuber similar to the potato. However, with some varieties of cassava, a staple in some parts of Africa, there&#x2019;s an issue. If not properly processed, it can harbor a lethal amount of cyanide. (This is not the case with the cassava grown in the Caribbean.) But soaking the peeled tuber in water for several days releases enzymes that degrade the cyanide-storage compound linamarin, causing the toxic cyanide to be dissipated into the air as hydrogen cyanide. Unfortunately cases of acute cyanide poisoning have occurred when famine conditions forced a shortening of the soaking time. Since even proper processing doesn&#x2019;t remove all the cyanide, chronic low-level exposure can lead to goiter or even �konzo,&#x201d; a type of paralysis. <br> <br>I&#x2019;ve described the cyanide connection in lectures numerous times but never before had I been asked a question about how I had acquired this knowledge. It did start me thinking. Indeed, I&#x2019;ve never been to Africa, have never even seen a live cassava plant. I&#x2019;ve never carried out any testing of cassava for cyanide. Truth be told, I wouldn&#x2019;t even know how to go about it, although I think with a little digging I could figure it out. I do have a vague recollection of once eating fried cassava somewhere in the Caribbean, but that&#x2019;s as close as I&#x2019;ve come to experimenting with the tuber. So, in fact, how do I know about its chemistry? It all comes down to reading various accounts of cassava poisoning in toxicology and chemistry texts. <br> <br>And how do the authors of these texts know what they are writing about? Chances are they haven&#x2019;t had any closer cassava encounters than I have had. But they have read the peer-reviewed literature on the topic, have digested the facts and have managed to piece together the story. They would have read papers in a medical journal about how the symptoms of �konzo&#x201d; were traced to cyanide poisoning and about how a link to cassava was discovered. Then in a chemical publication they would have learned that the actual culprit, linamarin, was present in unprocessed cassava but not in the soaked version. Finally, a paper likely in a biochemistry journal would have revealed the action of enzymes on linamarin. Basically, then, what we call scientific knowledge is gained through a distillation of the relevant peer-reviewed literature. And that literature is the altar at which scientists worship. But as with religion, there is faith involved. Faith that the peer-reviewed literature can be trusted. That faith, however, cannot be blind. It should be tempered with a dose of skepticism. <br> <br>Problems may eventually crop up even with research that was properly carried out. A side effect of a medication that affects a fraction of a percent of patients will not be detected in trials, but will become obvious when millions take the drug. So peer-review isn&#x2019;t the end-all. But remember what Churchill said about democracy? �It is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried.&#x201d; Ditto for the peer-review process. Peer review, however, is the final stage in a scientific investigation that usually begins with a �gee, that&#x2019;s funny&#x201d; comment after making some observation. And that observation may happen in a serendipitous fashion. But as Louis Pasteur would go on to say, �Chance favors the prepared mind.&#x201d; <br> <br> <br> <b>Fishy Claims for Fish Oil Supplements</b> <br>It&#x2019;s a pretty common scenario. An observational study suggests that some food or beverage is associated with some aspect of health. A hypothesis is forged about the effect being due some particular component. The component is isolated and tested in cell cultures or in animals with some intriguing results. A few small-scale human studies follow and generate optimism. Supplement manufacturers gear up and begin to flood the market with pills containing the supposed active ingredient. Their ads are supported by references to cherry-picked data, their hype couched with many a �may.&#x201d; Personal testimonials of benefit pour in and profits mount. The results of randomized, controlled double-blind trials (RCTs) begin to emerge with contradictory results. Marketers highlight the positive results and dismiss contradictory research as �flawed.&#x201d; Sales continue to increase with various producers claiming that their product is superior to that of competitors. <br> <br>As controversy mounts, researchers undertake �meta analyses&#x201d; that pool data from the best available studies. Results suggest that the initial optimism cannot be supported but there is a call for more studies. (Isn&#x2019;t there always?) Sales begin to slump as manufacturers and their industry associations scramble to punch holes in the meta analysis and issue press releases that emphasize the studies with positive findings. Regulatory agencies walk a fine line, having to take into account business interests, freedom of choice arguments and public health. Consumers are left bewildered, not knowing whom to believe or trust. In recent years we have seen such scenarios unfold with vitamin E, calcium, beta-carotene, ginkgo biloba and now, omega-3 fats. <br> <br>The omega-3 saga can be traced back to the early 1970s when Danish researchers discovered a surprisingly low incidence of heart disease in Inuit tribes despite a diet dominated by fatty fish. Could this be due to the specific type of fat found in fish, they wondered? After all, the molecular structure of these fats differed from the fats found in meat and most vegetables. Perhaps these �polyunsaturated fats&#x201d; which feature a double bond on the third carbon from the end of the molecule, the so-called �omega carbon,&#x201d; had some special cardioprotective property. This was a reasonable guess, given that other populations around the world that consumed a fish-rich diet, such as the Japanese, were also known to have a low incidence of heart disease. <br> <br>Laboratory studies soon revealed that the omega-3 fats have anti-inflammatory properties and can also reduce the clotting tendency of blood. Both of these observations mesh with theories of reduced cardiac risk. There were also implications of reduced blood pressure and a slowing of the progression of arteriosclerosis. Then came evidence of a lowered incidence of abnormal heart rhythms in fish consumers and a decrease in triglycerides in their blood, both established risk factors for heart disease. <br> <br>By the 1980s supplement manufacturers had begun to capitalize on the tantalizing studies and were filling capsules with various mixtures of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), the two dominant fatty acids in fish oils.

How does a reflection betray its identity? Why is it that when we look at a mirror we can see either our reflection or the mirror but not both at the same time? How and when do we learn to recognise our own reflection? What does a reflective surface look like and how can we distinguish it from a non-reflective surface? Why is it that certain paintings may be turned upside down and still be visually acceptable? How are the various qualities of reflection represented in art - from the diffuse sheen of burnished copper to the realism of silvered glass?<br>In this innovative book, published to accompany the exhibition Mirror Image at the National Gallery, London, Jonathan Miller discusses these puzzling questions and investigates the pictorial representation of reflection - 'sheen, shine, glimmer and gleam' - through a wonderfully varied selection of paintings and photographs, covering nine centuries, drawn from the National Gallery and other international collections.</p><p>When we look into a mirror, we do not "see" the surface, we see only our reflection. But in a painting, our eye is drawn to the marked surface of the canvas, which creates the illusion of a reflection. Jonathan Miller's <i>On Reflection</i>, published to coincide with his show "Mirror Image" at London's National Gallery, is a dazzling investigation of artists as diverse as van Eyck, D�rer, Vel�zquez, Ingres, Helen Chadwick, and Robert Mapplethorpe. Miller explores the tricks and games by which painting and, more recently, photography create this illusion of reflection.<p> The artistic representation of reflection has challenged artists for centuries, a problem particularly acute in Miller's most sustained example--the mirror. Drawing on studies of cognitive perception, <i>On Reflection</i> explains how we come to understand the difference between a reflection and "the real thing," and how vital reflections are in defining our own sense of identity. Miller's fascination with his subject comes across in bravura and original reassessments of the paintings he considers, and in the tricks that these works often play on the viewer. Lavishly and imaginatively illustrated, with wonderful inset captions that take the paintings apart in support of Miller's argument, this is one of the most enjoyable, accessible, and original books on art to have appeared in recent years.</p>Jonathan Miller has held appointments in the History of Medicine at the Wellcome Institute and a Leverhulme Fellowship in Cognitive Science at the University of Sussex. He has delivered the Clark Lectures at Trinity College, Cambridge and the T. S. Eliot Lectures at the University of Kent. He is an Honorary Fellow of St. John&#39;s College, Cambridge, an Honorary Doctor of Literature at the University of Cambridge and is a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians at London and Edinburgh.</p><h2>Rumi, Dancing the Flame</h2><p>POETRY: At last, after six years, another inspirational book of translations of Rumi's poems by Nader Khalili. 300 short poems (Rubaiyat) translated from the original Persian and illustrated with Persian calligraphy created for this book, and photographs of the Rumi Dome of lights designed by the author and built in Hesperia, California. <p>A sample poem: unknown existence, undiscovered beauty, that's how you are, so far, but, one dawn, just like a sun, right from within, you will arise.</p></p><p>Internationally renowned architect and author Nader Khalili is the director of Cal-Earth Institute, and the innovator of the Ceramic Houses and Superadobe technologies. Inspired by Rumi&#39;s poetry, his architecture is based on the four universal elements of earth, water, air, and fire, their equilibrium and unity at the service of the arts and humanity. &#34;Poetry crystallized into structure&#34; writes the new York Times. Khalili&#39;s four other books are: &#34;Rumi, Dancing the Flame&#34;, &#34;Racing Alone&#34;, &#34;Ceramic Houses and Earth Architecture&#34;, and &#34;Sidewalks on the Moon&#34;."Dancing the Flame" is that new dawn in man, bringing us inside the eternal fire, inside the fire. -- <i>Dr, Lorna Bernaldo</i><br><br>I cannot stop reading - not reading, feeling the poems - so alive, breathing, singing, burning - so many jewels you give... -- <i>Laura Huxley, author</i><br><br>There is a tremendous joie de vivre in these robust, passionate, and pithy short poems. -- <i>Frances Anderton, contributor, New York Times/Los Angeles Times</i></p><h2>The Brown Palace: Denver&#39;s Grand Dame</h2><p>One of the first fire-proof hotels in America was constructed at a cost of $2 million in 1892.

DeBill Jr. is the author's first short story fiction collection. His name should be familiar to many, as he was one of the authors included in the famous anthology DISCIPLES OF CTHULHU edited by E. Paul Berglund. THE BLACK SUTRA is a horror fiction collection, and will appeal to fans of H.P.

Twins Max and Molly and their grandmother's cat Baxter find a magnifying glass and an anatomy book. The glass reduces them to molecular size; they fall into the book, which has become a functioning female body; and the adventure begins. Their guide through the body is Freewilly, a sizable drop of body fluid. They meet the various functioning cells of the body, are attacked by body defenders such as white blood cells, and are subsequently rescued and transported by red blood cells, neurons, and lymphs. They do kill a cell, which is unforgivable, and must leave, making their way up a hair shaft and out a follicle. The writing is fairly straightforward, with ocasional lapses into the pseudo-eloquent: ``discoveries (in the attic) could challenge Matt to his utmost speculations and inspire Molly to raptures of elaborate imaginings.'' Each page is illustrated, usually with large, bright color drawings of the kids in their current predicament or of monster-like configurations of the attacking cells. Frequently accurate, usually labeled color diagrams of body parts are included. In all, it's a format reminiscent of some of the hi-lo adventure books for upper elementary/lower middle grades, and it will have limited appeal. It's a lot to plow through for those just looking for factual information, and, for pleasure readers, the outcome is all too predictable. Denise L.

Others, like the satanic leaf-tailed gecko (on the jacket) who disguises itself amidst leaves to blend into its surroundings, are the same year-round but their appearance seamlessly blends them into the environment. Grasshoppers of the genus <i>Paraphidnia</i> and the African mantis <i>Popa spurca</i> perfectly imitate the small branches of trees, becoming virtually invisible to predators and prey. </p><p> Some species use incredible stratagems to get rid of their enemies, of the frog <i>Physalaemus</i>, for example. When this amphibian is threatened, he turns his back to his opponent and shows his hindquarters on which is "painted" a pair of large black eyes. If the mask is not enough to intimidate the opponent, the fake eyes will emit an impressive "white secretion."

Jews and non-Jews smuggle people, goods, and anti-Bolshevik literature back and forth across the new political border. Filipov acts as the arbiter of "judgment" to prisoners in a Bolshevik outpost, who include Spivak, a counterrevolutionary; Lemberger, a pious and wealthy Jew; a seductive woman referred to as "the blonde"; and a memorable cast of smugglers and criminals.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ordinary people, depicted in a grotesque and modernist style&#x2014;comparable to Isaac Babel&#x2019;s <i>Red Cavalry</i>&#x2014;confront the overwhelming forces of history, whose ultimate outcome remains unknown.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>DAVID BERGELSON </b>(1884&#x2013;1952), a Jewish novelist, short-story writer, and literary editor, was born in Ukraine.

He returned to the Soviet Union in 1934, where he was eventually executed under Stalin&#x2019;s orders.

In his fourteenth collection, he curves this grand form away from the epic and toward the personal, examining the ruins of love and the puzzles of age as he enters his eightieth year. The title poem, punctuated by &#x201c;stalking egrets&#x201d; and &#x201c;clattering parrots&#x201d; and revved by a tree-tossing storm, is part elegy and part rhapsody and includes this artist&#x2019;s credo: &#x201c;The perpetual ideal is astonishment.&#x201d; That is the state of being Walcott summons as he takes measure of yearning, regrets, and resistance to turmoil, reveling, instead, in the exaltation of earth, sky, and ocean as birds embody feelings and poetry itself.

After receiving B.A. degrees in psychology and English literature from Lake Forest College, she spent half a year living in London and working in a bookstore, traveling once the work permit expired. Upon returning to the U.S., she embarked on a writing career while working at a local college to provide a steady income and traveling when possible, thus far ranging from Finland to Egypt. She currently lives in western Michigan, where she is a founding member of the oldest Mardi Gras krewe in the state.<br><br>Lord Satoris Banewreaker has the best of intentions when he opposes Haomane, his brother god, but his actions sunder the world of Urulat. Carey's complex Sundering fantasy series, of which this follows 2004's <i>Banewreaker</i>, challenges the reader more than her well-received Kushiel trilogy (<i>Kushiel's Dart</i>, etc.). The stately pace, the plethora of names and sentient species (of which Man is only one) and the difficult main characters&#x2014;cold, dignified gods&#x2014;will put off some fans of the earlier, more accessible series. In addition, the author owes too obvious a debt to Tolkien: hobbitlike folk bear powerful, mystical objects analogous to Frodo's ring, while the ethereally beautiful Cerelinde could have been lifted bodily from Loth Lorien. On the other hand, a figure like Tanaros, who retains his honor by slaying his wife and king for betraying him, shows Carey can still create strong, original characters, and the climax, when gods and men fall in battle like ninepins, not only nicely ties everything up but is quite moving as well. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Armed with both common sense and ingenuity, Linda Cobb made a name for herself on <i>Morning, Arizona</i>. For those of you who don't happen to live in Arizona, she has written this helpful little book. <i>Talking Dirty with the Queen of Clean</i> tackles just about any household stain, stink, or accident you can think of. <p> "There are five cleaning products you should never be without," says the Queen, "and most of them are things you already have in your home." What are they? White vinegar, baking soda, lemon juice, club soda, and Spot Shot Instant Carpet Stain Remover (her favorite brand). With these simple items, you can clean and deodorize nearly every room in your home, thereby saving money on expensive store-bought cleaners and reducing the amounts of chemicals in your home. Did you burn a casserole? Fill the dish with hot water, one tablespoon of baking soda, and soak. Try cleaning brass and copper with half a lemon sprinkled with salt. It should shine right up (and smell good, too).</p><p> The chapters are short and sweet, and besides the usual home/pet/kid/upholstery cleaning techniques, the Queen also tackles patio furniture, the grill, electronic equipment, plants, and smoke and water damage. Did you know you can distract grasshoppers by planting basil around your flowerbeds? They'll eat that and leave your flowers alone. Here's our favorite tip: when painting or washing walls, wrap washcloths or old rags around your wrists and secure them with rubber bands. When you lift your arms, the paint or water drips will be absorbed instead of running all the way down your arms. Keep this book handy. <i>--Dana Van Nest</i></p>About the Queen <br> <b>Linda Cobb</b> first shared her cleaning tips with readers in a weekly newspaper column in Michigan, where she owned a cleaning and disaster-restoration business dealing with the aftermath of fires and floods.

White males are a victimized minority on campuses across the country, thanks to affirmative action. Speech codes have silenced anyone who won&#x2019;t toe the liberal line. Feminists, wielding their brand of sexual correctness, have taken over.</i> These are among the prevalent myths about higher education that John K. Wilson explodes.<br>The phrase "political correctness" is on everyone&#x2019;s lips, on radio and television, and in newspapers and magazines. The phenomenon itself, however, has been deceptively described. Wilson steps into the nation&#x2019;s favorite cultural fray to reveal that many of the most widely publicized anecdotes about PC are in fact more myth than reality. Based on his own experience as a student and in-depth research, he shows what&#x2019;s really going on beneath the hysteria and alarmism about political correctness and finds that the most disturbing examples of thought policing on campus have come from the right. The image of the college campus as a gulag of left-wing totalitarianism is false, argues Wilson, created largely through the exaggeration of deceptive stories by conservatives who hypocritically seek to silence their political opponents.<br>Many of today&#x2019;s most controversial topics are here: multiculturalism, reverse discrimination, speech codes, date rape, and sexual harassment. So are the well-recognized protagonists in the debate: Dinesh D&#x2019;Souza, William Bennett, and Lynne Cheney, among others. In lively fashion and in meticulous detail, Wilson compares fact to fiction and lays one myth after another to rest, revealing the double standard that allows "conservative correctness" on college campuses to go unchallenged.<br></p><p>&#34;John Wilson shows in copious and devastating detail that, as obnoxious as Political Correctness of the Left has sometimes been, the Political Correctness of the Right is far more pervasive, virulent, and well-funded--as well as virtually unpublicized.&#34;--Gerald Graff, author of &#34;Beyond the Culture Wars&#34;John K.

It had made me very anxious, partly because I'd also been told that until my new baby brother or sister had arrived safely my mother would be in a dangerous condition. Something terrible might happen to her -- something that might make her very ill -- and it was all the more likely to happen if I myself did not pay proper attention. My father did not say what this thing was, but his gravity and terseness meant that it was a serious business. <br><br>My mother -- said my father -- was not supposed to sweep the floor, or carry anything heavy such as pails of water, or bend down much, or lift bulky objects. We would all have to pitch in, said my father, and do extra tasks. It would be my brother's job to mow the lawn, from now until June, when we would go up north. (Up north there was no lawn. In any case my brother wouldn't be there: he was heading off to a camp for boys, to do things with axes in the woods.) As for me, I would just have to be generally helpful. More helpful than usual, my father added in a manner that was meant to be encouraging. He himself would be helpful too, of course. But he couldn't be there all the time. He had some work to do, when we would be at what other people called <i>the cottage</i> but we called <i>the island</i>. (Cottages had iceboxes and gas generators and waterskiing, all of which we lacked.) It was necessary for him to be away, which was unfortunate, he continued. But he would not be gone for very long, and he was sure I would be up to it.<br><br>I myself was not so sure. He always thought I knew more than I knew, and that I was bigger than I was, and older, and hardier. What he mistook for calmness and competence was actually fright: that was why I stared at him in silence, nodding my head. The danger that loomed was so vague, and therefore so large -- how could I even prepare for it? At the back of my mind, my feat of knitting was a sort of charm, like the fairy-tale suits of nettles mute princesses were supposed to make for their swan-shaped brothers, to turn them back into human beings. If I could only complete the full set of baby garments, the baby that was supposed to fit inside them would be conjured into the world, and thus out of my mother. Once outside, where I could see it -- once it had a face -- it could be dealt with. As it was, the thing was a menace.</p><h2>The Wind Blows Death</h2><p>Who killed solo violinist Lucy Carless during a concert by the Markshire Orchestra? Was it her first husband? Or her second?

Also presented is an exploration of the ritualistic aspects of eighteenth-century warfare and an analysis of Shays' Rebellion as a tax revolt.

For Pannenberg one can only talk about God when one at the same time talks about Jesus. Theology and Christology, the doctrine of God and the doctrine of Jesus as the Christ, are therefore insuperably bound together. This book develops the connection systematically, through a careful mode of biblical, dogmatic and philosophical exposition.</p><p>Wolfhart Pannenberg is Professor of Systematic Theology Emeritus at the University of Munich.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Secrets of A Summer Night</h2><p>A romance set in London during the 1840&#39;s</p><p></p><h2>The Barn Owl&#39;s Wondrous Capers</h2><p>Set in the eighteenth-century calcutta, the second city of the empire is teeming with scandalous gossip and rumour abravanel ben obadiah ben aharon kabariti, sephardic jew from syria and trader in novelties such as corsets, aphrodisiacs and zebras, befriends the british officers and the local elite by day and records their escapades by night in a leather-bound journal 1950s paris a battered copy of the journal surfaces in a hole-in-the-wall antique shop in montmartre london, 2002 a phone rings in the east end, late at night, announcing a death and an inheritance: a silver lighter, a vintage motorcycle, an ancient radio and the barn owls wondrous capers what follows is a bizarre chain of events involving eccentric zamindars, a decadent aristocrat with a passion for lady footballers, a psychic cartographer, a haunted office building and, at the centre of it all, digital dutta, neighbourhood historian and keeper of secrets</p><p>Sarnath Banerjee studied image and communication at Goldsmiths College, University of London.

Andrews has chronicled her path of self-discovery and her explorations into feminine spirituality in nine books in the "Medicine Woman" series, which include <em>Jaguar Woman, The Woman of Wyrrd,</em> and <em>Shakkai.</em> She is also the author of <em>The Power Deck,</em> a series of self-affirming meditational cards, and <em>Teachings Around the Sacred Wheel,</em> a workbook. Andrews leads seminars across the country and offers an annual intensive retreat. She lives in Los Angeles, California.In a bizarre addition to her Sisters of the Shield series (The Woman of Wyrrd, 1990, etc.), Andrews recounts her ``spiritual'' adventures in a future life as a young Japanese woman, an acolyte of Shakkai, keeper of the sacred gardens--an image of nature, its healing power, and the inner female life. Encouraged by her longtime spiritual guides, the indefatigable Cree women Agnes Whistling Elk and Ruby Plenty Chiefs, Andrews ``double dreams'' herself back and forth between her cabin in Manitoba and a Japanese countryside. In Japan, through Shakkai, she meets a demonic ``tea master'' who is jealous of her writing, and acquires a hu, a gourd resembling Agnes's ``celestial rattle''--a symbol of inner power, the ``uterus of all life,'' a ``universal womb'' that rather lewdly resembles a phallus. She also acquires a samurai lover who is about to decapitate her at both the beginning and end of the book--a brutal and totally mysterious action that, like their coupling, her vomiting, and her eating beef jerky and sharing a Coke and a sandwich with a couple of sorcerers, seems to contradict the spirituality, beauty, and peace she claims to have derived from her experience. Indeed, whatever Andrews's enlightenment consisted of, it did not include the power of speech: the stilted dialogue, the ``pigeon'' English of her various teachers, the clich&#x201a;s in which they express their message--all recall at best the Lone Ranger and Tonto. Without illumination or even casual connection, Andrews's odyssey comes off more like a psychotic episode than a spiritual journey, displaying apparent dissociation, dislocation, a disordered sense of time, hallucinations, and an inability--or at least unwillingness--to distinguish fantasy from reality. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The Great War was over and American optimism was higher than the stock market. What better moment to launch an expedition to Antarctica, the planet&#x2019;s final frontier? There wouldn&#x2019;t be another encounter with an unknown this magnificent until Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon.<br> <br>Everyone wanted in on the adventure. Rockefellers and Vanderbilts begged to be taken along as mess boys, and newspapers across the globe covered the planning&#x2019;s every stage. And then, the night before the expedition&#x2019;s flagship set off, Billy Gawronski&#x2014;a mischievous, first-generation New York City high schooler desperate to escape a dreary future in the family upholstery business&#x2014;jumped into the Hudson River and snuck aboard.<br> <br>Could he get away with it?<br> <br>From the soda shops of New York&#x2019;s Lower East Side to the dance halls of sultry Francophone Tahiti, all the way to Antarctica&#x2019;s blinding white and deadly freeze, Laurie Gwen Shapiro&#x2019;s <i>The Stowaway</i> takes you on the unforgettable voyage of a plucky young stowaway who became a Jazz Age celebrity, a mascot for an up-by-your bootstraps era.</p><p>Laurie Gwen Shapiro is an award-winning documentary filmmaker and journalist. <i>The Stowaway</i> is her first full-length work of nonfiction.The Stowaway PROLOGUE<p></p> <br><br> <br>With his back against the sunset, a seventeen-year-old boy lingered on the docks along the Hudson River. By his calculations, it was a ten-minute swim from where he stood to the ship.<br> <br>The new high school graduate waited, his soft grey eyes fixed on the City of New York, moored and heavily guarded on the Hoboken piers. The sun went down at six forty-five this day&#x2014;August 24, 1928&#x2014;but still he fought back his adrenaline. He wanted true darkness before carrying out his plan. At noon the next day, the ship would leave New York Harbor and sail nine thousand miles to the frozen continent of Antarctica, the last frontier on Earth left to explore. He intended to be aboard.<br> <br>That summer, baby-faced Billy Gawronski was three inches short of his eventual height of five foot eleven, and his voice still squeaked. &#x201c;You are a late bloomer,&#x201d; his doting immigrant mother told him in thickly accented English. Yet the ambitious dreamer, born and raised in the gritty tenement streets of the Lower East Side, was as familiar with Commander Richard Evelyn Byrd&#x2019;s flagship as any reporter assigned to cover its launch. The Antarctica-bound barquentine was an old-fashioned multi-masted ship that suggested the previous century, with enchanting square sails arranged against an almost impenetrable maze of ropes. The 161-foot wooden vessel spanned half a city block, her 27-foot beam taller than a three-story building. Sail- and steam-powered and weighing 200 tons, with sturdy wooden sides 34 inches thick, she had seen duty as an Arctic icebreaker for Norwegian seal hunters starting in 1885. On one run in icy waters in 1912, her captain had been the last to see the Titanic; just ten miles away, he&#x2019;d been afraid to help the sinking ship, as he was hunting illegally in territorial waters. Like so many immigrants, the ship once known as Samson found her name changed when she arrived in America in 1928, becoming the City of New York. She was the most romantic of the four boats in Byrd&#x2019;s cobbled-together flotilla, and the one leaving first&#x2014;with the greatest fanfare&#x2014;early the next afternoon.<br> <br>Several times in his mind that evening, Billy dove into the Hudson and started swimming, only to find his feet firmly on land. But he had been on board the SS New York before. Nine days earlier, he and two thousand other New Yorkers had taken the Fourteenth Street Ferry to Hoboken, New Jersey, and gaped at the City of New York, moored next to the grand Dutch ocean liner the SS Veendam. The crowd was wowed with anticipation. Just past noon, the ship&#x2019;s captain, Frederick Melville&#x2014;second cousin of the nineteenth-century author Herman Melville&#x2014;gave the okay, waving the first sweaty guests up the gangway, their dollar admission supporting the Byrd Antarctica expedition&#x2019;s fund-raising drive. Several members of Melville&#x2019;s crew, including the chief engineer, Thomas &#x201c;Mac&#x201d; Mulroy, and sixty-year-old veteran sailmaker John Jacobson, joined him in greeting the adoring public. No, he told them, Byrd was not aboard. Everyone still wanted to gawk.<br> <br>When it had been Billy&#x2019;s turn to board, he&#x2019;d wandered the wooden decks, still cargo free to accommodate guests. The poop aft (rear deck) was elevated, housing Commander Byrd&#x2019;s cabin, an elegant wood-paneled chart room, and a state-of-the-art radio room with technology that would let the explorers be heard no matter how far they sailed. Under the poop deck were spaces for the machine room and the radio generator. One level down were seven cabins&#x2014;the cramped quarters where the men would sleep&#x2014;as well as several storerooms, and lockers for holding mops and paint. He stood in the machine room with other tourists&#x2014;men and women content to admire all the nifty gadgets. Also aft were the ship&#x2019;s engine and oppressively hot boiler room.<br> <br>None of these places had been right for a hiding spot. Forward proved more promising, with its large fo&#x2019;c&#x2019;sle (forecastle, a front deck), and a second, smaller fo&#x2019;c&#x2019;sle in the peak: a narrow hollow under the bowsprit (a thick pole projecting from the upper end of a sailing vessel) of the boat&#x2019;s prow (the part of the bow above the water). Here, under this second hidden fo&#x2019;c&#x2019;sle, Billy had spied a good-sized space in a shelf. The exposed top fo&#x2019;c&#x2019;sle would be visible to anyone on the ship during the departure ceremonies, but the second fo&#x2019;c&#x2019;sle would remain dark. Satisfied with his investigation, the lad grabbed one of the commemorative paper cups set aside as a souvenir before heading for the ramp.<br> <br>Afterward, still on a high, Billy had walked the New Jersey shoreline until he&#x2019;d scouted the lookout site he was in now, a long distance from the ship but not out of reach for a superior swimmer like himself. Another ocean liner had taken the Veendam&#x2019;s place next to the expedition ship in Hoboken&#x2019;s busy Pier 1: the SS Leviathan, headed overseas the next day, too. The Leviathan dwarfed its famous ice-bound companion vessel in dock.<br> <br>With the twilight not yet dissipated, Billy still had an excellent view of the many ships going up and down the brackish southern-flowing Hudson. Could a ship hit him as he swam? He ate what little food he&#x2019;d brought: an apple and an egg salad sandwich. As for what he would eat after that? He hadn&#x2019;t bothered to think about it.<br> <br>Even under the dimming sky, Billy could make out the shadowed bodies of stationed watchmen, but he was unsure if they were Byrd&#x2019;s crew or borrowed Coast Guards keeping vigil. There would be no sneaking up the gangway, the narrow metal plank for boarding. He would have to swim out to the unprotected side of the ship, the side facing the water. Who would think to guard the edges of the ship away from the pier? Once aboard, he did not have a sure grasp on how he would reveal himself to Commander Byrd or justify his presence on the expedition, but he trusted he could wing it.<br> <br>In Byrd, Americans like Billy now had a superexplorer of their own&#x2014;someone who could stand proudly beside England&#x2019;s legendary Ernest Shackleton and Robert Falcon Scott, not to mention Norway&#x2019;s Roald Amundsen, the crafty strategist who in 1911 had been the first to reach the South Pole, just five weeks ahead of Scott&#x2019;s team. The thirty-nine-year-old blueblood Virginian &#x201c;Dick&#x201d; Byrd was a slight but strong man with a chiseled, smooth-shaven face. He looked the part of a hero and acted like one, too, admired already for the responsible, safety-first ethics he had demonstrated exploring the North Pole by ship and plane in 1926. Now he had set his eye on the South.<br> <br>Byrd&#x2019;s team would be the first American expedition to Antarctica since Lieutenant Charles Wilkes and his exploring party poked around the coast eighty-eight years before, in February 1840. And Wilkes had not even set foot on the continent itself.<br> <br>When the commander&#x2019;s four ships reached Antarctica, the coldest, windiest outpost imaginable, he would unload a specially designed Ford trimotor three-propeller transport plane with a seventy-foot wingspan&#x2014;the first commercial aircraft sturdy enough to weather a 120-mile-per-hour flight over the South Pole; only 199 of the planes were manufactured. The wings and fuselage were constructed from corrugated duralumin, a light, strong alloy of aluminum, copper, manganese, and magnesium, while the landing gear and bracing were all steel. Byrd&#x2019;s underlings would assemble it on the ice barrier that guarded the continent of Antarctica, and, with the aid of a pilot, he would fly over the polar plateau, proudly dropping the Stars and Stripes from the sky. Two more monoplanes (a plane with only one set of wings) were sailing on other ships farther southbound to 90 degrees south: a small Fokker and an even smaller Fairchild. With the introduction of airplanes to Antarctica, Byrd and his pilots would have the first bird&#x2019;s-eye views of its great mysterious interior, and no doubt add to the fragmentary maps of the south polar region, a landmass Byrd believed to be greater than that of the United States and Mexico combined&#x2014;at least five million miles. But as Billy told his family and friends, no one was sure.<br> <br>Breathless articles in prominent publications such as Scientific American and Popular Mechanics heralded the dawn of the mechanical age of exploration and asked readers with the sketchiest knowledge of Antarctica to imagine a pilot seeing the United States from the air for the first time, spotting a Grand Canyon here, a buffalo herd there. Was Antarctica home to animals that had never been seen? Indigenous people? Lost dinosaurs?<br> <br>Even Billy&#x2019;s Polish grandmother, with her rudimentary English, agreed that it was marvelous to be living in an age when man could do such things as fly over a frozen continent. So why did everyone except his babcia scoff whenever Billy said he wanted to have a life as adventurous as Byrd&#x2019;s?<br> <br>In the rags-to-riches decade of the 1920s, everyone in the papers seemed to be living big, meaningful lives, from slugger Babe Ruth, to fashionable Coco Chanel, to comic genius Charlie Chaplin. Jews and blacks had broken through: the Marx Brothers achieved overnight fame after their Broadway debut, and provocative entertainer Josephine Baker packed them in at Paris&#x2019;s Folies Berg�re. New York City in 1928 was the rolling-in-the-dough town immortalized by F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose smash 1920 debut novel, This Side of Paradise, was assigned to English classes at Billy&#x2019;s alma mater, Manhattan&#x2019;s progressive Textile High School. Adults, or at least city dwellers, were having a grand old time; only the most sober investors knew that the stock market was not on a permanent high.<br> <br>Even once-penniless immigrants were doing better for themselves. Billy knew he would inherit the one-man interior decorating business his father had established after arriving in New York as a destitute young man. Now that his boy would graduate in four short years from Cooper Union, a prestigious, free college in Greenwich Village, Rudy Gawronski was ready to add &#x201c;and Son&#x201d; to his sign. Billy&#x2019;s application to Cooper Union had been decent; he supposed he had a knack for art as well as history and languages, but who wanted to study history when you could make history? The thought of a humdrum future stuffing furniture mortified him.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>By nearly nine o&#x2019;clock on that August night, darkness draped the sky, and lights began to sparkle on in the new downtown skyscrapers&#x2014;young, electric edifices from a decade of big money. From where he crouched, Billy could see the pyramid atop the Bankers Trust Company Building on Wall Street; the wedding-cake-shaped thirty-story Standard Oil Building on lower Broadway; the forty-story Ritz Tower on Park Avenue; and the first of the city&#x2019;s Art Deco towers, such as the New York Telephone Building on West Street, completed just months before. Great buildings that proved great things were possible.<br> <br>Billy stayed awake hours into the night, guessing and second-guessing the right moment to jump off the pier. Glory was not for the skittish, he told himself. Still, he was scared about low visibility under blackened skies; afraid that he might lose his way and drown, although he&#x2019;d easily managed dozens of river swims with his athletic father and with his downtown friends. But was anyone more determined than Billy to hitch a ride on the most famous rig in America? It was the bold, he was certain, who won the right to adventure.<br> <br>A few minutes past four in the morning, he&#x2019;d had enough waiting.

He followed British financiers around the City, capturing them in their traditional top hats and long coats, creating images that depict them in a poetic dance with their fog-shrouded environment. He shot pictures of workers, men delivering coal, children playing on the streets, people waiting or relaxing in the parks, and images of poverty. In these photographs he juxtaposed money and work, wealth and poverty, creating a dynamic photographic project that has never been shown before in its entirety.

Without overwhelming the student with details, it discusses a wide range of issues that are important for the interpretation of Isaiah. The book consists of three parts. In the first part, Herbert Wolf discusses the more traditional introductory questions: the world of Isaiah, the theories of multiple authorship, the structure of Isaiah, and Isaiah&#39;s poetry. The second part is a detailed paragraph-by-paragraph analysis of the prophecy itself. The last part of the book discusses Isaiah&#39;s christological and eschatological emphases. Detailed footnotes and an extensive bibliography facilitate further study.</p><p>Herbert Wolf was associate professor of theological studies at Wheaton College, Illinois. His area of expertise was Old Testament studies. Dr. Wolf held degrees from Wheaton College, Dallas Seminary, and Brandeis University. He was the author of Haggai and Malachi: Redemption and Renewal.Chapter 1 THE WORLD OF ISAIAH The era in which Isaiah lived witnessed the rise and fall of kingdoms, as major military powers vied for control of Palestine. During his ministry, which spanned most of the second half of the eighth century B.C., Assyria emerged as the dominant world power. In 722 B.C. the mighty Assyrians captured the capital city of Samaria and brought about the full collapse of the northern kingdom of Israel. Thousands of Isaiah&#39;s countrymen were taken into exile, never to return to their beloved homeland. The southern kingdom of Judah also staggered before the Assyrian juggernaut, and in 701 B.C. Judah nearly suffered the same fate as Israel. Judah had sided first with Assyria and then with Egypt during the stormy years between 734 and 701 B.C. By the close of the century, Hezekiah joined the coalition against Assyria, and the armies of Sennacherib advanced to punish the Judean king. But God miraculously intervened and crushed the invader&#39;s forces, granting Judah and Jerusalem a century-long reprieve. Yet before disaster struck his army, Sennacherib had devastated most of the cities of Judah and deported thousands of its citizens. In those traumatic times, Isaiah alternated between condemning and encouraging, as the moral and spiritual condition of the rulers and the people of Israel dictated. But the historical scope of Isaiah&#39;s prophecies is far broader. He looked beyond the flowering of the Assyrian Empire to the rise of the Chaldean kingdom of Babylon, and he portrayed the demise of Babylon before the onslaught of Cyrus&#39;s Median and Persian armies (chs. 41--48). Assyria fell in 612 B.C., and their Babylonian conquerors were defeated by Cyrus in 539 B.C. Thus Isaiah interacted prophetically with the three major empires between 750 and 539 B.C., outlining their impact on Israel and Judah and showing how they fit into the sovereign purposes of God. A BRIEF PERIOD OF PROSPERITY IN ISRAEL About 800 B.C., King Adadnirari III of Assyria weakened the power of Damascus, relieving the pressure the Syrians had exerted on Israel. This fact, combined with the decline of Assyria shortly after that, allowed Jeroboam II of Israel and Uzziah of Judah to enjoy a period of great prosperity from 790--750 B.C. Neighboring lands, such as Moab and Edom, once more came under Israelite or Judean control, and the combined territories of the two kings approximated the area ruled by King Solomon. The economic gains of both regions were considerable (2 Chron. 26:7; 27:3), but that did not prepare them for the ghastly invasions and sieges of the last half of the century. In Israel, more than in Judah, this prosperity was accompanied by an increase in idol worship, materialism, and oppression of the poor (Amos 4:1--4; 6:1.), though Isaiah 2:6--8 reveals that Judah was rapidly becoming like her northern relatives in these respects. Additionally, the rich were &#39;buying out&#39; the small farmers, creating a wider gulf between the wealthy and the poor (5:8--10). THE GROWTH OF ASSYRIA&#39;S POWER UNDER TIGLATH-PILESER III During the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III (745--727 B.C.), Assyria began to reassert its authority over Syria and Palestine. In 740 B.C. this powerful monarch, also called Pul (1 Chron. 5:26), attacked the states of northern Syria, and by 738 B.C. he was receiving tribute payments from Damascus and Israel. A coalition against Assyria was formed by Hanun of Gaza, Rezin of Damascus, and Pekah of Israel. They hoped that Egypt would join them. But in 735 B.C. Tiglath-Pileser made a surprise attack in the west, winning the submission of these rulers. The Assyrians penetrated as far as the border of Egypt, where Hanun had fled for refuge. Later, after promising to be a dutiful vassal, this Philistine ruler was allowed to return to Gaza. A year later Damascus attempted to organize another revolt against Assyria. Rezin and Pekah wanted the support of Judah in this venture, so they pressured Jotham (and later his son Ahaz) to help them (2 Kings 15:37). Their campaign against Judah is often called the Syro-Ephraimite War, and it likely came to a head in 734 B.C. According to Isaiah 7:1 and 2 Kings 16:5, Syria and Israel besieged Jerusalem in an attempt to overthrow Ahaz and to place &#39;the son of Tabeel&#39; on the throne (Isa. 7:6). &#39;Tabeel&#39; may be a personal name, but there is good evidence that it refers to a region located north of Ammon and Gilead.1 The land of Tob, to the east of Gilead where Jephthah fled, may have been the same area ( Judg. 11:3). Perhaps Jotham or Ahaz had married a princess from Tabeel, and her son was being groomed as the new king. The conspiracy may also have been aimed at the complete ouster of the Davidic dynasty. When Ahaz learned about the forthcoming invasion, he was deeply alarmed. Apparently Ahaz had suffered heavy losses during a previous battle with these kings (2 Chron. 28:5), and he hoped to avoid another disaster. Isaiah was sent to calm Ahaz&#39;s fears and to assure the king that Rezin and Pekah would not prevail against him. Ahaz needed to trust the word of God and to abandon his plans to appeal to the king of Assyria for help. Otherwise Judah herself would eventually suffer at the hands of an Assyrian monarch (Isa. 7:17). This was the context in which Isaiah delivered his famous prophecy about the sign of Immanuel. God was with Judah and would protect her if Ahaz exercised faith. From 2 Kings 16:7--9 it is clear that Ahaz did request the assistance of Tiglath-Pileser, sending him silver and gold as payment, and the Assyrians eagerly returned to capture Damascus and to kill Rezin. Most of the cities of Israel were also captured and many of the people deported. Isaiah referred to this invasion in 9:1, mentioning the gloom that covered the regions of Zebulun, Naphtali, and Galilee. As a result of this campaign, the northern territory of Israel was annexed by Assyria. Galilee and Jezreel became the province of Megiddo. The coastal plain on the west was known as the province of Dor, and the region east of the Jordan was turned into the province of Gilead. Out of appreciation for his &#39;rescue,&#39; Ahaz journeyed to Damascus to meet with Tiglath-Pileser. There he was fascinated by a pagan altar and had Uriah, the priest, build one like it in Jerusalem. Subsequently, Ahaz began to worship the gods of Damascus and to plunge Judah into the idolatry that was so heinous to Isaiah (Isa. 2:20; cf. 2 Chron. 28:20--23). The shattered remains of the northern kingdom came under the control of Hoshea, son of Elah, who assassinated the disgraced Pekah in 732 B.C. Tiglath-Pileser mentions Hoshea among his vassals and mentions that Ahaz of Judah paid tribute to Assyria.</p><h2>Firebirds Soaring: An Anthology of Original Speculative Fiction</h2><p>First <i>Firebirds</i>.

In addition, the horse will be desensitized to the everyday frightening stimuli that typically elicit a flight reaction in the young horse, and which account for the frequent injuries that afflict horses and the people who work with them.<br>The book includes nineteen chapters beginning with initial imprinting training, then following with subsequent sessions, halter training, performance basics, response reinforcement, problem prevention, and sections on racehorses, mules, and brood mares.<br> <br></p><p>Probably one of the most exciting and beneficial breakthroughs in equine psychology and training in the last decade has been the procedure the author calls "imprint training," the behavior-shaping learning process that occurs immediately after a foal's birth. Renowned veterinarian, clinician and lecturer Dr. Robert M. Miller researched, developed and presented these techniques to a world full of horsemen and - women eager to bond with their horses, understand them better and help them to live more comfortably and willingly in a world full of humans.<br>Dr. Miller, like most of us, was taught the conventional wisdom that excessive handling of newborn foals would result in spoiled foals and the risk of rejection by the mare. However, in over 30 years of veterinary practice, he found just the opposite. Foals he was forced to handle because of obstetrical emergencies turned out to be gentle and unafraid of him later on, and they recognized him. Horses, like deer, cattle, sheep and certain fowl, are a "precocial" species and are imprinted by what they see moving around them after they're born.<br>Dr. Miller experimented with his own foals, maximizing their handling at the time of birth to imprint them. He added desensitizing procedures and later conditioned responses to create "imprint training," a technique that�s now in use all over the world, with all breeds and other precocial species, as well.<br>This book contains Dr. Miller's theories and techniques, including step-by-step procedures involving bonding, habituation and sensitization. He discusses how to properly handle the mare before, during and after imprinting. There are subsequent sessions detailing how to tie and halter-break the foal, and the added bonus of teaching performance basics that ultimately aid in under-saddle training. Dr. Miller also addresses problems and their prevention, plus the handling of special cases, such as race horses and mules.<br>ROBERT MILLER, D.V.M. is a world-renowned veterinarian, animal behaviorist, author, and lecturer. Since 1965, he's been a much sought-after speaker at universities and veterinary and horsemen's groups on various aspects of veterinary science and horsemanship.

The result is at once a speculative biography, a theatrical history, and a re-creation of the Elizabethan age. Whether a vivid retracing of the evolution Elizabethan theater, a bravura reconstruction of the first performance of Hamlet, an infiltration of the intricacies of the court of the Virgin Queen, or an elegy on the era's end with the distrastrous Essex Rebellion, Burgess -- author of the classic A Clockwork Orange -- sets the stage for England's most glorious time and turns the spotlight on the figure of William Shakespeare.

They attacked the forest as if it were an enemy to be pushed back from the beachheads, driven into the hills, broken into patches, and wiped out. Many operators thought they were not only making lumber but liberating the land from the trees. . ." from The Last Wilderness, by Murray Morgan, 1976 <p>Derrick Jensen, prize-winning author of A Language Older than Words and The Culture of Make Believe, and George Draffan, activist, researcher, and co-author with Jensen of Railroads &amp; Clearcuts, collaborate again to expose the escalating global war on trees. Ever since Gilgamesh cut down the ancient cedar forests of Mesopotamia, civilizations and empires have foundered and collapsed in the wake of widespread deforestation. Today, with three quarters of the world&#x2019;s original forests gone and the pace of cutting, clearing, processing, and pulping ever accelerating, Jensen and Draffan lay bare the stark scenario we face&#x2014;we being not only people, but the nonhuman fabric of life itself&#x2014;unless deforestation is slowed and stopped. A must-read for anyone who wants to understand the relationship between deforestation and our ecological crisis as well as an essential "handbook" for forest and anti-globalization activists.</p></p><p>Derrick Jensen is the author of The Culture of Make Believe; A Language Older than Words; Listening to the Land: Conversations about Nature, Culture, and Eros; and co-author of Railroads &amp; Clearcuts. The Culture of Make Believe was one of two finalists for the 2003 J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize. He writes for The New York Times Magazine, Audubon, and The Sun among many others. <p>George Draffan is a forest activist, public interest investigator, and corporate muckraker. He is the author of The Elite Consensus, A Primer on Corporate Power, and co-author of Railroads &amp; Clearcuts. For the past fifteen years he has provided research services and training to citizens and public interest groups that are investigating and challenging corporate power. Some of his work can be found at Endgame, a project of the Public Information Network.</p>Jensen (The Culture of Make Believe) and Draffan (A Primer on Corporate Power) are both pessimistic and angry about the state of the world's forests. In the U.S. only five percent of native forest remains; forests on a global level are also under attack, with one estimate claiming that two and a half acres are cut every second. International deforestation causes the extinction of plants and animals in addition to driving human forest dwellers, like the Karen of Burma, the Mapuche of Chile and the Penan of Malaysia, from their homelands. The destruction of forests also results in flooding, erosion and landslides. Production of paper products releases highly toxic chemicals into both the air and water. The authors provide many instances of collusion between industry and government, which has led to a U.S. commercial timber and logging industry permitted to destroy forests almost without restriction. Environmental agencies such as the Sierra Club or the Environmental Defense Fund, according to Jensen and Draffan, are more interested in raising money than in raising discomfort among the economically powerful. Globalization, they argue, is a network of financial, legal and political structures that operate for the benefit of the economic elite, allowing those in power to consume the natural resources of other nations. Although the text is occasionally overwrought, the authors have carefully documented worldwide deforestation, as well as the serious environmental and human consequences, and point a finger at those responsible. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Christmasaurus</h2><p><b>Why settle for a pony or a puppy for Christmas when you could have a dinosaur?

Squillions of years ago, in fact. Long before your granny and your granddad were born. Before there were any human beings at all. Before cars and airplanes, even before there was the internet, there was something even better.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <br> <b>DINOSAURS! </b><br> Dinosaurs were the most awesome creatures ever to walk the planet. There were lots of them, and they came in all shapes and sizes. There were small ones that were not much bigger than dogs or cats, some with spiky prickle horns on their backs. There were stupendously ginormous ones called Seismosaurus that were longer than five double-decker buses, with necks thicker than tree trunks and skin like the hard rubber tires of a tractor. I know that sounds hard to believe, but it&#x2019;s definitely true, because this is a book, and books don&#x2019;t lie. <br> I&#x2019;d like to tell you about two very special dinosaurs. We&#x2019;ll call them Momosaurus and Dadlodocus. (Those weren&#x2019;t their real names, of course&#x2014;that would just be silly.) <br> Momosaurus and Dadlodocus had been out all day in the hot, hot heat of the prehistoric sun and were returning home to their tidy little nest. But what they found in its place was something horrendously horrible: an almighty pile of rocks, bones, and dust. Their home had been raided by evil scavenger dinosaurs, and these sneaky, scroungy little scavengers had smashed it up completely! <br> But for Momosaurus and Dadlodocus, the mess was the last thing on their minds, because they had left their most precious things alone inside the nest: twelve dinosaur <i>eggs</i>, which were now nowhere to be seen! <br> As you can imagine, Momosaurus and Dadlodocus were devastated. They stood in the wreckage of their nest, weeping and roaring for a very long time, until the sun went down and the moon and stars filled the sky above the jungle. <br> That night, a light breeze was blowing through the enormous trees, and a sliver of silvery moonlight found its way to the remains of the nest. Suddenly, something caught Dadlodocus&#x2019;s eye. Something smooth and shiny was reflecting a moonbeam from under a pile of bones and mud. He quickly and gently lifted the rocks and rubble, and there it was, gleaming, perfectly unharmed in the moonlight. <br> It was their one last <i>EGG.</i> <br> How this one and only egg had escaped the hungry scavengers&#x2019; rampage was a mystery. Perhaps their greedy tummies were full up, or maybe this egg had rolled out of sight when they were smashing and crushing the others. Whatever the reason, all that mattered was that Momosaurus and Dadlodocus had one egg left. The tiny dinosaur that was curled up safely inside that egg became the most important thing in the world to them, and they weren&#x2019;t going to let anything bad happen to it ever again! <br> But something bad <i>was</i> about to happen&#x2014;something that would change the world forever. <br> Something <b>big.</b> <br> Something <b>astronomically, intergalactically, outer spacey-wacey big!</b> <br> The pearly moonlight that blanketed the dinosaurs&#x2019; broken nest suddenly seemed to turn yellow. Then the yellow turned orange and then to a hot, fiery red. Momosaurus and Dadlodocus peered out from their home, staring in disbelief. It was as though the moon itself was on fire! <br> As they watched, the whole sky turned into a violent fireworks display of whizzing hot rocks and shooting stars&#x2014;and not the kind of shooting stars that you and I know, which swoosh prettily over the sky like beautiful little scratches of light in space. These ones didn&#x2019;t swoosh by at all. These ones smashed straight down like red-hot thunderbolts that exploded into thousands of fireballs as they hit the Earth! <br> Panic and chaos consumed the jungle. Flaming trees were uprooted by huge, five-double-decker-bus-sized dinosaurs, and smaller dinosaurs were squished and trampled. The night sky was brighter than the lightest day, and the moon felt hotter than the midday sun&#x2014; but there was only one thing on Momosaurus&#x2019;s and Dadlodocus&#x2019;s minds. <br> Protecting their egg! <br> They <i>had</i> to get their egg to safety! <br> So they ran. They ran as fast as their dinosaur feet could carry them, desperately clinging to that last, treasured egg. They joined the stampede of thousands of terrified dinosaurs fleeing the danger, but no matter how fast and how far they ran, they couldn&#x2019;t seem to escape. After all, how can you run from the sky? <br> Momosaurus and Dadlodocus were swept into the crowd, pulled this way and pushed that way in a great sea of dinosaurs, and as hard as they tried, they just couldn&#x2019;t hold on to their egg any longer! <br> It slipped from their grip and fell to the ground. <br> Now, I bet you&#x2019;re thinking that the egg was crushed instantly, right? Well, smarty-pants, it wasn&#x2019;t, actually! <br> A pile of leaves broke the egg&#x2019;s fall, and it rolled into the stampede, unharmed. It was kickerbashed and knockerboshed every which way&#x2014;but it <i>still</i> didn&#x2019;t crack! Momosaurus and Dadlodocus chased after it as it bounced between giant Diplodocus legs and rolled under stomping Stegosaurus feet, narrowly avoiding being squished time after time. It rolled and rolled, as if it had a mind of its own, falling from rocky ledges to treetops and swooshing down slushy mudslides, as Momosaurus and Dadlodocus desperately chased after it. <br> If Momosaurus and Dadlodocus had been looking up at the sky instead of trying to find their egg, they would have seen such a terrifyingly, heart-stoppingly, frighteningly scary sight. The whole sky was on fire above them. What they had thought was the flaming moon was, in fact, a whopping, giganterrific planet smasher of a meteorite. It had traveled from the deepest depths of space and was about to smash-whack into planet Earth and wipe out all the dinosaurs forever! <br> But just before the meteorite did its planet smashing, the lucky egg rolled all the way to the edge of a tall, jagged cliff, high above the ferocious ocean. All Momosaurus and Dadlodocus could do was watch helplessly as their last precious egg, with their tiny baby dinosaur inside, calmly toppled over the edge of the cliff and out of sight. <br> Gone forever. <br> The egg fell straight down, missing the rocky face of the cliff by inches. This was a very lucky egg indeed! It plopped peacefully into the ocean below, like a pebble in a lake, and instantly sank deep into the darkness, leaving the fiery chaos of the world above the waves. Eventually it came to rest on a soft, sheltered spot on the ocean floor as the meteor shower it left behind rained down unforgivingly, destroying every living dinosaur on the planet. <br> Except one. <br> The one inside the egg! <br> While the egg lay peacefully at the bottom of the ocean, the world continued to burn&#x2014;and then it froze solid, in an ice age that would last for thousands of years. <br> There the egg remained, deep in the ice, frozen in time, just waiting to be discovered.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><h2>Dance in the Vampire Bund, Vol. 8</h2><p><p>The assassins are dead but an invisible enemy still lurks in the peaceful island nation known as the Vampire Bund.

But the closer he got to the politicians, the more pompous and vapid they appeared. How could he write anything meaningful about these puffed-up martinets, much less vote for them? Nevertheless, Taibbi forged on and continued his responsibilities as a serious campaign reporter&#x2014;though not without frequent bouts of blind panic, drug use, and donning a gorilla suit. <br><br><i>Spanking the Donkey</i> indicts the surreal irrelevance of today&#x2019;s mainstream politics with barbed wit and caustic intelligence. Follow Taibbi as he covers the primary for the 2004 presidential election, joining him for a spot on John Kerry&#x2019;s campaign plane, face-to-face encounters with John Edwards&#x2019;s pancake makeup, enough Howard Dean press conferences to memorize the good doctor's stump speech by heart, and&#x2014;just to spice things up&#x2014;a two-month stint working undercover in a Republican campaign office in Orlando, Florida. Brimming with uncensored opinions and total truth, Taibbi captures the real American political mind; as a patron at Flo&#x2019;s Bar in Manchester, New Hampshire, eloquently puts it: &#x201c;They all suck . . . who&#x2019;s running?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gonzo journalist Matt Taibbi will do anything . . . to bring political reporting back to life. <i>Spanking the Donkey</i> is all the more necessary in the aftermath of an election that harnessed enough liberal outrage to light the Vegas strip, cost more than a billion dollars, absorbed hundreds of hours we will never get back, and achieved absolutely nothing.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Salon<br><br></i></p><p>Matt Taibbi is a roving national reporter for <i>Rolling Stone</i>. Before that he was a columnist for the <i>New York Press</i> and editor of the satirical magazine <i>eXile</i>.IRAQT-UP!<br><br> At the D.C. Rallies, a Few Hundred Thousand Go Missing<br><br> Originally published in The Beast, this piece about the February 2003 anti-war rally in Washington is included here to show one side of the beginning of the campaign season--when there was an enormous amount of idealistic political energy organized against the war. By the end of the campaign, this energy would be mostly gone--replaced with a more confused show of support for a candidate who had supported the war, John Kerry.<br><br> Washington, D.C., Saturday, January 17, 2003--It is cold as a bitch out here. Journalism of any kind, in fact, is practically impossible. Less than ten minutes after arriving here at this small tree-lined park in the shadow of the Washington monument, I had to ask Beast publisher Paul Fallon for an extra pair of gloves to put on over the thin leather ones I was wearing. If you've ever tried to take notes on a legal pad in below-freezing temperatures while wearing two pairs of gloves at the same time, you can understand the obstacles I've faced.<br><br> It's been a difficult morning. We had come out early that morning for the first--and most disturbing by far--of the weekend's Iraq-related protests. The main event, the anti-war protest at the mall sponsored by International A.N.S.W.E.R. (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism), was due to start at 11 a.m. This pre-event, scheduled for 9 a.m., was the day's journalistic appetizer, a freak show too tantalizing for any responsible press organ to ignore. It was the prowar demonstration, run by one of the most amazingly named organizations in the history of American activism.<br><br> MOVE-OUT stood for Marines and Other Veterans Engaging Outrageous Un-American Traitors.<br><br> The MOVE-OUT protest was like a caricature of a left-wing paranoid's idea of a staged CIA diversion. It had all the elements of a low-budget piece of fake political theater: a suspiciously high level of press participation (according to our careful count, there were eighty "protesters" and forty journalists), a pile of carefully rationed "protest" placards with high production values (a nicely airbrushed painting of George Bush in a muscle-bound Uncle Sam pose), a near-total absence of local protesters, and, last but not least, a single well-dressed, smiling, traitorous black person representing the "cause" (Kevin Martin, head of the "African-American Republican Leadership Council"). This thing was about as spontaneous as the applause for Comrade Stalin at the Fifth Party Congress. Offered the chance, I would have bet serious money that at least half of the protesters were secretaries and janitors from the NSA offices.<br><br> My hands were numb because I had kept them out of my pockets for long stretches in a frantic attempt to record for posterity the amazing rhetoric of the MOVE-OUT speakers. Some of the speeches were of a type not seen since Bluto rallied the troops in Animal House. Only this wasn't slapstick comedy; this was real. Martin gave a typical speech: "Our troops have always been there for us," he said, "from the time of World War I, when our soldiers beat back the fascists in France. . . ."<br><br> I turned to Paul. "France?" I said. "Fascists? What the fuck is he talking about?"<br><br> Paul shrugged. "Forget it," he said. "He's on a roll."<br> Paul and I had come down here from Buffalo to take part in the A.N.S.W.E.R. anti-war rally, and I have to admit that my expectations were low. Like most young Americans, I've been trained to think of protests and demonstrations as something shameful and vaguely embarrassing--something one outgrows, like Journey albums, or those hour-long showers you took when you were eleven and twelve.<br><br> It's not hard to see why people my age (in their early thirties and younger) think that way. Our parents were all part of a scrupulously documented protest generation that they subsequently renounced. Oliver Stone aside, the movies and documentaries the people from our parents' generation made about the 1960s inevitably describe a generation that was maybe well-meaning in a bluntly stupid kind of way, but on the whole extremely indulgent, narcissistic, and naive, a bunch of rich jerks flinging their braless chests and stinky beards in the direction of their parents' grim, sexually repressed, business-driven world.<br><br> Our parents are ashamed that they left behind all those movies of them burning their bras and eating acid at Monterey. They're ashamed because they ultimately became everything they were against back then: cynical, greedy careerists. That's why they created this atmosphere that celebrates the uncompromising protest of Mohandas Gandhi on the faraway Asian continent as brave and principled, but teaches us that protest in our own country is just something that's nice to try when you're young, before you get a real job. To be socially conscious today, the older generation tells us, all we have to do is watch Silkwood a few times, and recycle. All the really hard work here, after all, was already done in the 1960s.<br><br> I admit to being influenced by all of this. My previous experiences with protests have all tended to confirm the worst stereotypes about modern activism. In anti-globalization, pro-environment, and anti-Kosovo War rallies I saw almost exclusively well-off people of my age and class dressed down and plainly living out some revolting Oliver Stone-inspired 1960s fantasy (the most damning evidence of which, incidentally, is the tendency of these protesters to run to the cameras and start mugging in John-and-Yoko poses as soon as TV crews arrive). More than once I've come across protesters who barely even knew what they were protesting; the important thing, obviously, was the protest itself, the poetic act of participating.<br><br> But the most glaring problem with all of these protests I've seen is this sense that no one involved in them actually hoped to accomplish anything. At so many of the protests of our generation, you can sense a sort of willingness to comply with the wishes of our parents--protest, sure, but only do it for the "experience," as something to do. Turn it into a sort of street theater, a way to meet girls. Whatever you do, don't make it matter. In a glib, permissive age where dissent, protest, certain forms of civil disobedience, and even the occasional arrest are superficially acceptable and even encouraged, the only real taboo when it comes to having political convictions today is meaning it. And in thirty-two years I haven't seen anyone break that taboo on any real scale.<br><br> Washington would be a little different. Not that it mattered. In order to even hear what happened there, you had to be there. Our illustrious national press corps saw to that.<br> At the MOVE-OUT protest in the morning I had gotten into an argument with some of the mainstream reporters covering the event. Not that that was surprising. A blatantly staged media event like the MOVE-OUT demonstration is the kind of thing that any journalist with even a sliver of a conscience left is bound to be extremely defensive about having attended.<br><br> After all, one would be hard-pressed to think of any circumstance not involving a progovernment counterdemonstration in which forty journalists from major news organizations would attend a 9 a.m. weekend rally involving eighty illiterate morons. To use the Russian expression, crayfish will whistle in the mountains before eighty environmentalists in a park on a Saturday morning draw so much as a college radio intern, much less forty of the country's heaviest press hitters. The mere presence of so much press at the MOVE-OUT demonstration was monstrous.<br><br> So when I arrived at the scene I thought it would be amusing to count the total number of journalists, as opposed to actual protesters. And wouldncha know it, some members of the working press were offended by the exercise.<br><br> "You shouldn't be doing that now," a bearded Reuters hack told me, after suffering the indignity of being counted. "It's too early. The bulk of the crowd won't show up until later. Like around ten-thirty."<br><br> "Well," I said. "The Washington Post said this thing was supposed to start at nine. It's now nine-thirty."<br><br> "The Post was wrong," the Reuters man snapped. "If you want to be honest, you'll do this later."<br><br> "Let me get this straight," I said. "You're actually worried that I'm going to undercount these yahoos?"<br><br> "I'm saying," he said, "that if you want to be fair, you'll count when the crowd really shows up."<br><br> Next to the Reuters man stood a young blonde woman in black horn-rimmed glasses who identified herself as a reporter for the New York Times. She didn't offer her name, but another reporter there later told me that she was an assistant to Times reporter Lynette Clemetson. She'd been listening to my exchange with the Reuters man and decided to chime in.<br><br> "And the important thing isn't the numbers," she said. "This demonstration has more Vietnam veterans."<br><br> I shook my head, stunned. "Are you kidding?" I said. "The other demonstration will have a hell of a lot more vets than this one, I'm sure of that."<br><br> She frowned. "No," she said. "That one's going to be mostly college students. Kids."<br><br> "Maybe so," I said. "But just in terms of sheer numbers . . . I mean, even half a percent of 100,000 is going to be ten times more vets than we're seeing here. There are about fifty people here, for Christ's sake."<br><br> "No," she said, not convinced. "No, this one will have more."<br><br> A third personage, a scrawny redneck protester in a baseball cap and a Gore-Tex face guard, was listening in. "That's the slimiest journalism I've ever seen," he said, jumping in. "You're in here and you're going to count us before we're even here. You wait until ten-thirty, then you'll see how many of us there will be. You're yellow journalism scum."<br><br> "Settle down, Beavis," I said.<br><br> "You wait until ten-thirty, you liberal bastard," he said.<br><br> I shrugged and walked away. An hour later, after suffering through numerous historically confused speeches about our victories over fascists in France and our spectacular, as-yet-unrecognized military successes in Vietnam, I counted all over. The final tally, again, was eighty protesters and forty journalists, and that included the five-man Guardian Angel security entourage that followed speaker Curtis Sliwa. I sought out a Gore-Tex face in the crowd.<br><br> "Hey, Chester," I said. "Eighty to forty. Nice turnout."<br><br> "Fuck you," he hissed. "We represent the real America."<br><br> "You know," I said, "I once went to a Suzanne Somers book signing. There were like three hundred people there. It was a book of poetry."<br><br> "Fuck you," he repeated.<br><br> A few yards away, a mealy-faced young man in a blue button-down shirt named Eric DuVall was quietly taking notes. An intern under Washington-based reporter Jerry Zremski, he was the representative of the Buffalo News. We would later spot him in the crowd at the main demonstration. Like me, he was observing the crowds. Only his conclusions would be a little different from mine.<br> Right from the start, there were two things about the A.N.S.W.E.R. demonstration that were startling. The first was its staggering size. I'd read about the last demonstration in November and had tended to believe the conservative estimates of the crowd size, not believing that more than a very small number of people like me would be sufficiently motivated to go anywhere to protest the inevitable. But the crowd at Washington last weekend was truly gargantuan.<br><br> Police admitted to the Washington Post that it was the largest anti-war rally since the Vietnam era, and that it was much larger than the October rally. I personally could not see the end of the crowd. It took a good half-hour to make my way to the front of the crowd, and from a speaker platform up on the press podium I was able to get a look at the gathering as it stretched back along the Mall. Even from an elevated position, I couldn't see the end.<br><br> Later on, when the crowd filed out to march to the Navy Yard, it proved impossible to determine how far the line of people stretched. The length of the march was several miles, and, again according to the Washington Post, the crowd was still entering the beginning of the route at the Mall when the first marchers at the front reached the Navy Yard.<br><br> From where I sat, there was no question that there were at least 200,000 people present, and probably closer to 300,000. The extraordinary turnout was the chief topic of conversation along the march: time after time, I spotted marchers turning to look back, shaking their heads at the trailing crowd, and saying, "Holy shit!" Walking in a gathering this size, you get a sense of its building kinetic energy and potential destructive power: a chain-link fence near the Mall that obstructed a group of shortcut seekers, for instance, simply blew away like dandelion fuzz once the crowd decided to walk through it. This was far different than the feeling one gets exiting an NBA game, for instance.<br><br> Back to the size later. The second thing that was striking about this crowd was that, despite the fact that it was composed largely of middle- to upper-middle-class whites, there was no name politician from either major party there to address it. Given that a Pew survey taken this week showed that a majority of Americans (52 percent) felt that President Bush had not yet made a convincing case that war was necessary, one would have thought that at least some opportunistic politician from the Democratic Party would have decided to attach his or her name to the anti-war effort. But the only politician of any stature at the event was the Reverend Al Sharpton, a doomed candidate for president with too much political baggage to really be an effective champion for anything.<br><br> Put two and two together and what you get is the amazing realization that this crowd, perhaps the largest to gather in Washington in the last thirty years, has no political representation whatsoever in today's America. Almost certainly representing a vastly larger number of people in the general population, the anti-war crowd has simply been excluded from the process.<br><br> The eighty nitwits at the MOVE-OUT event could reasonably claim one sympathetic U.S. senator per demonstrator: the 200,000+ at the A.N.S.W.E.R. event couldn't claim even one. The only real clout it could claim was its own physical presence at that particular moment.<br><br> All of which makes sense, because from the very beginning, the character of this war has been that of a giant end-run around common sense, around international law, around political reality, even around basic human logic. When you've spent half a year getting your head around the idea that a terrorist attack by Islamic fundamentalists somehow necessitates the immediate invasion of an unrelated secular dictatorship, or that opposing an offensive war is somehow evidence that one "hates America" and is a traitor, it isn't hard to see how 250,000 people in this country these days can actually, in real terms, be numerically fewer than 80.</p><h2>Looking for Mr. Goodbar</h2><p>Terry Dunn, a young schoolteacher alone with the temptations, opportunities, and threats of the city, engages in a bar- and bed-hopping search for Mr. Right that ends with her New Year&#39;s Eve murder</p><p>Judith Rossner [1935&#x2013;2005] was an American novelist, most famous for the bestseller, <i>Looking for Mr. Goodbar</i> (1975).<i> </i>A lifelong New Yorker, her books centered around the themes of urban alienation and gender relations.</p><h2>Walleye (The Hunting and Fishing Library)</h2><p>Discusses the behavior and habitats of walleyes and offers advice on how to locate and fish for walleyes</p><p></p><h2>Indigo</h2><p>Two young women--brash and confident Xanthe and self-conscious and uneasy Miranda--return to the island of Enfant-Be+a7ate, where their ancestor landed three hundred years before, to find fortune and adventure. 12,500 first printing.</p><p>Marina Warner has an international reputation as a critic, historian and novelist. Her non-fiction works include The Beast to the Blonde, No Go the Bogeyman and Fantastic Metamorphoses, while her fiction includes the novels The Lost Father (shortlisted for the Booker Prize), Indigo and The Leto Bundle, and short story collections including Murderers I Have Known.From British writer Warner (The Lost Father, 1989, etc.), an uneven--if politically correct--reinterpretation of The Tempest that's weighed down even further by heavy-handed dollops of magic realism. When the young and second wife of her distinguished grandfather, Sir Anthony Everard, gives birth to beautiful Xanthe, Miranda, a child herself, hears an old princess at the christening wish upon the baby a ``kind of imperviousness--the heartlessness of a statue.'' Having neatly indicated mythic and legendary undertones, the story then moves back to the 17th century--to the Caribbean island where the Everard family made its fortune in indigo and sugar. There, island sorceress Sycorax miraculously rescues a baby from a drowned slave, establishes her own compound at the end of the island where she grows indigo, and advises the islanders. The baby, the original Caliban, is soon joined by another outcast, an Arawak baby girl called Ariel. Eventually, Caliban, haunted by his African roots, leaves--but Ariel stays, only to be seduced by the first Kit Everard come to claim the island for his own. Their Eden threatened, the islanders rebel, a now-returned Caliban is killed, and Everard and his men are saved by a fluke. Forward, then, to the 20th century when Xanthe and Miranda, different in temperament and experience, are invited to the island to celebrate the anniversary of the first Everard landing. Xanthe makes a marriage of convenience and sets about restoring the family fortunes through tourism, but the islanders resent her efforts. A revolt breaks out; Xanthe, who finds love too late, is killed--a sort of long-deferred expiation of Everard guilt; and Miranda, returning to London, marries a black actor and finds happiness. The tempest seems finally over. Better on the past than on the present, with the story coming most alive when Warner describes Sycorax and the pristine island. Otherwise: too much pretentious profundity and polemical handwringing. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

By turns plain and transcendent, these poems meditate on trees, bacteria, wasps, buildings, roots, and stars, ending with twinned elegies and poems of praise that open into spaces that are both magical and archetypal for human imagination: forests and seashores. As always, Hillman's vision is entirely original, her forms inventive and playful. At times the language turns feral as the poet feels her way toward other consciousnesses, into planetary time. This is poetry as a discipline of love and service to the world, whose lines shepherd us through grief and into an ethics of active resistance. Hillman's prior books include Practical Water and Seasonal Works with Letters on Fire, which received the Griffin Prize for Poetry. Extra Hidden Life, Among the Days is a visionary and critically important work for our time.

I brought Brenda's latest book to keep me company, Extra Hidden Life, among the Days, and can think of no better traveling companion. Large-hearted and strangely idiosyncratic, this book is a record of a fiercely independent mind at work, in turns song-filled and surprising.

K. Chesterton first published in 1905.Each story in the collection is centered on a person who is making his living by some novel and extraordinary means (a "queer trade", using the word "queer" in the sense of "peculiar"). To gain admittance one must have invented a unique means of earning a living and the subsequent trade being the main source of income.The framing narrative by "Cherub" Swinburne describes his quest for The Club of Queer Trades with his friend Basil Grant, a retired judge, and Rupert Grant, a private detective who is Basil's younger brother. Each of the stories describes their encounter with one of the trades.Contents: The Tremendous Adventures of Major BrownThe Painful Fall of a Great ReputationThe Awful Reason of the Vicar's VisitThe Singular Speculation of the House-AgentThe Noticeable Conduct of Professor ChaddThe Eccentric Seclusion of the Old Lady.Gilbert Keith Chesterton, (29 May 1874 &#x2013; 14 June 1936), was an English writer, poet, philosopher, dramatist, journalist, orator, lay theologian, biographer, and literary and art critic. Chesterton is often referred to as the "prince of paradox".Time magazine has observed of his writing style: "Whenever possible Chesterton made his points with popular sayings, proverbs, allegories&#x2014;first carefully turning them inside out. Chesterton is well known for his fictional priest-detective Father Brown,[5] and for his reasoned apologetics. Even some of those who disagree with him have recognised the wide appeal of such works as Orthodoxy and The Everlasting Man.[4][6] Chesterton routinely referred to himself as an "orthodox" Christian, and came to identify this position more and more with Catholicism, eventually converting to Catholicism from High Church Anglicanism. George Bernard Shaw, his "friendly enemy", said of him, "He was a man of colossal genius."[4] Biographers have identified him as a successor to such Victorian authors as Matthew Arnold, Thomas Carlyle, Cardinal John Henry Newman, and John Ruskin. Chesterton was born in Campden Hill in Kensington, London, the son of Marie Louise, n�e Grosjean, and Edward Chesterton.[8][9] He was baptised at the age of one month into the Church of England,[10] though his family themselves were irregularly practising Unitarians.[11]According to his autobiography, as a young man Chesterton became fascinated with the occultand, along with his brother Cecil, experimented with Ouija boards. Chesterton was educated at St Paul's School, then attended the Slade School of Art to become an illustrator. The Slade is a department of University College London, where Chesterton also took classes in literature, but did not complete a degree in either subject.In September 1895 Chesterton began working for the London publisher Redway, where he remained for just over a year.[14] In October 1896 he moved to the publishing house T. Fisher Unwin,[14] where he remained until 1902. During this period he also undertook his first journalistic work, as a freelance art and literary critic. In 1902 the Daily News gave him a weekly opinion column, followed in 1905 by a weekly column in The Illustrated London News, for which he continued to write for the next thirty years.Early on Chesterton showed a great interest in and talent for art. He had planned to become an artist, and his writing shows a vision that clothed abstract ideas in concrete and memorable images. Even his fiction contained carefully concealed parables. Father Brown is perpetually correcting the incorrect vision of the bewildered folks at the scene of the crime and wandering off at the end with the criminal to exercise his priestly role of recognition and repentance. For example, in the story "The Flying Stars", Father Brown entreats the character Flambeau to give up his life of crime.</p><p>Gilbert Keith Chesterton, KC*SG (29 May 1874 - 14 June 1936), better known as G.

Jointly operated by the governments of Germany and Turkey, the purpose of the mission was to persuade the emir to declare full independence from the British Empire, enter the war on the side of the Central Powers and attack British India. The ultimate aim was part of Hindu-German conspiracy to provoke a nationalist revolution in India which would undermine British power in the region. Britain saw this mission as a serious and credible threat - so much so that they tried to intercept the travellers in Persia, en route from Istanbul to Kabul and subsequently deployed their own intelligence and diplomatic strategies to ensure that Afghanistan would retain its neutral position. Although the Hentig-Niedermayer expedition was ultimately unsuccessful, it had lasting consequences and served as a sign of the continuing German infatuation with the Middle East and Central Asia, which had begun under Bismarck and continued through the interwar period, until World War II.<br>Written in a narrative style, this book provides a gripping account of the expedition, highlighting a previously little-known aspect of World War I.</p></p><p>Jules Stewart is a journalist, historian and author.

Hymns from The Book of the Dead illustrate the beliefs of the Egyptian peoples regarding the afterlife, judgment after death, resurrection, and immortality. The writings of E.A. Wallis Budge are considered somewhat controversial today because of his use of an archaic system of translation, but useful illustrations and an abundance of information make them necessary resources for students of the ancient world as well as those of the evolution of historical study. Conveying the beauty and power of the religion of ancient Egypt, this fascinating book remains an important work today. Sir E.A. WALLIS BUDGE (1857-1934) was curator of Egyptian and Assyrian antiquities at the British Museum form 1894 to 1924. Among his many works of translation and studies of ancient Egyptian religion and ritual is his best-known project, The Egyptian Book of the Dead.</p><p>Sir E.A.

It is the night of their high-school graduation and Myst and Grouper, two bright, well-to-do teenagers, have driven to the local lovers leap for a private celebration. Myst is seventeen, and the daughter of a fading rock star of dubious morals; Grouper is also seventeen, and the son of an ambitious, self-important U.S. Senator. Myst is determined to deprive Grouper of his virginity, but he wants to wait until they are married and settled into domesticity. As they drink beer, smoke pot and engage in sharply amusing, yet disheartening, interplay, it becomes increasingly evident that they are very lost young souls whose ideals have been sadly eroded by the shoddy, self-centered example of their elders. In the end they do make love, but it proves to be only a brief respite before their pasts encroach on the present and, inevitably, overwhelm it with terrible and heartrending results.</p><p></p><h2>Kasztner&#39;s Train: The True Story of an Unknown Hero of the Holocaust</h2><p><p><b>The heroic story of the "Hungarian Oscar Schindler" who saved thousands of Hungarian Jews from certain death at the hands of the Nazis, only to be accused of collaboration and assassinated in Israel twelve years after WWII ended. </b><br><b></b><br><b></b>Oscar Schindler's and Raoul Wallenberg's efforts to save people from Nazi extinction are legendary; Rezso Kasztner, by contrast, is practically unknown, even though he may have been the greatest rescuer of Jews during World War II. He was also the most controversial, and that, along with the relative lack of focus on events in Hungary toward the end of the war, has no doubt led to his anonymity. Now, with the publication of Anna Porter's remarkable chronicle, Kasztner's achievements are in full view. </p><p>When the German army invaded its ally Hungary in March 1944, followed soon after by Adolf Eichmann and his SS, Rezso Kasztner and a small group of Zionist activists stood in the way of mass deportations. They had met the well-informed Schindler, providing him with funds for food and clothing, and had been involved in previous efforts to rescue Jews from Slovakia and Poland. Now, in meeting after meeting with Eichmann and other SS officers, Kasztner negotiated for freedom, exploiting the Nazi weaknesses of greed and need&#x2015;"blood for goods," as the Nazis called it&#x2015;organizing a train out of Hungary for almost 2,000 while several thousand more were protected in work camps in Austria. Inevitably he saved some and not others. After testifying at the Nuremberg trials, Kasztner emigrated to Israel where, in 1956, he was stunningly convicted of collaborating with the Nazis more than a decade before. As he awaited the appeal that would ultimately exonerate him, he was assassinated by right-wing activists in Tel Aviv on March 4, 1957. </p><p>Based on interviews with those who were on the train and with family members of those denied a place on it, as well as documents and correspondence not previously published, Anna Porter tells the dramatic full story of one of the heroes of the twentieth century.</p></p><p><p><b>Anna Porter </b>was born in Hungary and personally experienced the Hungarian Revolution in 1956. A celebrated former publisher in Canada, she is the author of five previous books, including <i>The Storyteller</i>, a memoir of her family through seven centuries of Hungarian history. She lives in Toronto.</p><p>&#x201c;The saga author Anna Porter recounts is surely the stuff of novels. Consider this paradox: the man who saved more Jews than anyone in the Holocaust immigrates to Israel after the war and is convicted as a Nazi collaborator. How can this be? As Porter tells it, lawyer Rezso Kasztner, a leading member of the Hungarian Jewish Rescue Committee, "desperately negotiated" with the Nazis to buy the lives of 1,684 Jews, who would be packed onto "Kasztner's Train" and ridden to safety in Switzerland. Here's the hitch: most of the travelers had paid their patron $1,500 each for their tickets, thus establishing a threshold which might be called, "How much freedom can you afford?"<br>Kasztner appealed his conviction and was ultimately exonerated, but while awaiting appeal, he was assassinated in Tel Aviv on March 4, 1957. But not all Jews, by any means, felt Kasztner's actions were a simple Faustian bargain. Israel's Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem unveiled Kasztner's private archive on the 50th anniversary of his death, in a mission to restore his reputation.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>History Wire</i></p><p>&#x201c;Kasztner appealed his conviction and was ultimately exonerated, but while awaiting appeal, he was assassinated in Tel Aviv on March 4, 1957.

Animated by her understanding of the Hungarian context, Anna Porter relays her story with, as was said of the Jewish revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg, impeccable moral taste.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Michael R. Marrus, professor emeritus of Holocaust Studies, University of Toronto</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Anna Porter] vividly brings to life those frenetic months in Budapest before the Nazi collapse. Although she shows Kasztner with all his weaknesses and flaws egotistical, vain, ambitious and unfaithful to his wife she concludes that he was indeed heroic in risking his own life daily and saving thousands of Jews. Yad Vashem, releasing the results of its study of Kasztner's voluminous documents, notes and correspondence, recently came to the same conclusion. There was no man in the history of the Holocaust who saved more Jews and was subjected to more injustice than Kasztner, said Yad Vashem chairman Joseph Lapid, himself a survivor from Hungary, in July 2007, releasing the conclusions of Yad Vashem's research on Kasztner's papers. This is an opportunity to do justice to a man who was misrepresented and was a victim of a vicious attack that led to his death, he added, calling Kasztner, one of the great heroes of the Holocaust.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Adam Fuerstenberg, The Forward</i></p><p>&#x201c;The unknown hero of the title is Rezso Kasztner, a member of the Jewish Rescue Committee in Hungary during World War II. He was able to negotiate a deal with the Nazis, which resulted in Kasztner's Train--a train that transported 1,684 Hungarian Jews out of Nazi-controlled Hungary to safety in Switzerland in July 1944. The wealthy Jews of Budapest paid an average of $1,500 for each family member; the poor paid nothing. Kasztner also was able to save 20,000 Hungarian Jews by having them sent to an Austrian labor camp instead of extermination camps. Kasztner moved to Israel after the war, and in 1954 he was accused of being a Nazi collaborator. Kasztner claimed that his dealing with the Nazi officials, including Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Eichmann, were necessary to save lives. In 1957, he was assassinated by right-wing activists in Tel Aviv. Porter interviewed 75 people and had access to diaries, notes, taped interviews, memoirs, and courtroom testimonies; her book, with three maps and a 16-page black-and-white insert, offers the most complete, fully documented account of this Holocaust story.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Glowing chronicle of an unheralded, Schindler-esque figure who saved Hungarian-Jewish lives during World War II...A compelling narrative that does great justice to Kasztner's memory.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus</i></p><p>&#x201c;A tale of rescue as remarkable as Wallenberg or Schindler.

He soon secures employment as the personal assistant of Gordon Crace -- a famous expatriate novelist who makes his home in a dank and crumbling palazzo, surrounded by fabulous works of art, piles of unanswered correspondence and the memories of his former literary glory. <br> <br> Before long Adam becomes indispensable to the feeble Crace, and he finds himself at once drawn to and repelled by his elderly employer's brilliant mind and eccentric habits. As Adam comes to learn more about the scandal that brought Crace to Venice years ago, he realizes he has stumbled upon the raw material that could launch his own literary career and makes a bold decision: He will secretly write the famous author's biography. But outsmarting Crace is easier said than done, and the two soon find themselves locked in a bitter contest over the right to determine how the story of Crace's life will end. Against the haunting backdrop of the serene city, the two men engage in a ruthless game of cat and mouse that builds to a breathtaking and unexpected conclusion.</p><p>Andrew Wilson has follwed <i>Beautiful Shadow</i>, his stunning biography about Patricia Highsmith, with his debut novel, <i>The Lying Tongue</i>, a book that follows in Highsmith's own tradition of plot twists and psychological conundrums. <p> Adam Woods arrives in Venice from England to take a job and work on his novel. The job quickly evaporates, so he finds another, as amanuensis to a reclusive old author, Gordon Crace. Things start out in a straightforward manner. The author is eccentric, to say the least, but after tidying up the place and perusing the fine art collection, Adam settles in. Crace has written one book, refuses to talk about it and tells Adam that he doesn't want his authorial life even mentioned. It is over. </p><p> The only thing we know about Adam is that he just graduated from college and his love affair ended badly. We subsequently find out that when his girlfriend broke up with him he raped her to show her how much she really wanted to be with him. Enter Adam, the sinister creep. That is just the beginning of what we find out about him, about Gordon and what they are both capable of in this revelatory tale of two truly despicable people. After finding two interesting--and damning--letters among Gordon's castabout papers, Adam decides to abandon his novel and write Crace's biography. </p><p> Wilson keeps us guessing as Adam leaves Gordon for a week, pleading a need to attend his grandmother's funeral. He goes back to England to head off another biographer, to snoop around to see what she has gleaned, and to do a bit of research on his own. Things do not go exactly as planned, but Adam is more than equal to whatever heinous act it takes to advance his own cause. When he returns to Venice and Gordon, the creep factor increases dramatically and ends in a crafty and perfect conclusion, one that the reader is not prepared for... which makes it that much better. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>Andrew Wilson is an award-winning journalist and author.

Just when it seemed Italian pastas might hijack traditional American home cooking, Mexican dishes materialized on the nation's tables. In fact, this book's first recipe is for guacamole. East Asian cooking puts in few appearances here, and sushi remains a restaurant dish only. Most startling is the European-influenced casual use of wines and spirits in all kinds of appetizers, entrees, and desserts. Current emphasis on food's nutritional value manifests itself in tables enumerating calories, proteins, carbohydrates, and fats appended to each recipe.

Long favored as an essential guide to this history, <i>Buddhism in America</i> covers the three major groups that shape the tradition&#x2015;an emerging Asian immigrant population, native-born converts, and old-line Asian American Buddhists&#x2015;and their distinct, yet spiritually connected efforts to remake Buddhism in a Western context. <br><br>This edition updates existing text and adds three new essays on contemporary developments in American Buddhism, particularly the aging of the baby boom population and its effect on American Buddhism's modern character. New material includes revised information on the full range of communities profiled in the first edition; an added study of a second generation of young, Euro-American leaders and teachers; an accessible look at the increasing importance of meditation and neurobiological research; and a provocative consideration of the mindfulness movement in American culture. The volume maintains its detailed account of South and East Asian influences on American Buddhist practices, as well as instances of interreligious dialogue, socially activist Buddhism, and complex gender roles within the community. Introductory chapters describe Buddhism's arrival in America with the nineteenth-century transcendentalists and rapid spread with the Beat poets of the 1950s. The volume now concludes with a frank assessment of the challenges and prospects of American Buddhism in the twenty-first century.</p><p>Richard Hughes Seager is professor of religious studies at Hamilton College and the author of <i>Encountering the Dharma</i>; <i>The World's Parliament of Religions: The East-West Encounter, Chicago, 1893</i>; and <i>Dawn of Religious Pluralism: Voices from the World's Parliament of Religions</i>.<p>Praise for the first edition: "This well-informed book provides a comprehensive survey of a variety of Buddhist traditions in the contemporary U.S....

From the Red Scare incited by Joseph McCarthy to the election of John F. Kennedy as president in 1960, the 1950s heralded some of the most striking and clashing aspects of twentieth-century America: the Korean War and I Love Lucy; the Bunny Hop and Brown v. Board of Education; bikinis and UFOs; Disneyland and the polio vaccine; Elvis and Allen Ginsberg; the Invisible Man and Roman Holiday; Marilyn Monroe and Jackie Kennedy. The evocative images in this volume&#x2014;many never before published&#x2014;chart a contradictory decade, transcending what we have come to know as "the age of Ozzie and Harriet." Provocative and endearing, best-selling journalist James Conaway&#x2019;s entertaining and highly readable year-by-year survey will resonate with a generation that came of age in the 1950s but also prove compelling to younger audiences who identify with that hopeful yet uneasy epoch.</p><p>James Conaway is the author of nine books of nonfiction, among them Memphis Afternoons and Napa: The Story of an American Eden, and several novels, including Nose and The Big Easy. Alan Brinkley is the Allan Nevins Professor of History at Columbia University. His books include The Publisher: Henry Luce and His American Century.&#x201c;From the pages and archives of <i>LOOK</i> magazine, a publication that defined the Fifties in images and words, comes this handsome photographic celebration of the complicated, often contradictory era that transformed America&#x2019;s identity through an unprecedented confluence of socio-economics, culture and politics at the end of World War II. With 200 color and black and white photos, it&#x2019;s a chronological museum of memories charting the ups and downs of a nation as it finds its way through the often mixed signals of Ozzie and Harriet and I Love Lucy, John F. Kennedy, James Dean, Disneyland, suburban prosperity, urban slums and other touchstones from an era that wasn&#x2019;t quite as simple as it might seem.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The Media Tourist</i><br><br> &#x201c;<i>Look</i> Magazine, published between 1937 and 1971 it was known for its large-scale photographs, and&nbsp;was a historic record of the era. <i>The Forgotten Fifties</i>, includes rare images of celebrities like Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn, and Jackie Kennedy, as well as iconic images of the time...[a] handsome photographic celebration of the complicated, often contradictory era...the book is a visual walk down memory lane.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Photo District News</i><br><br> &#x201c;<i>The Forgotten Fifties</i> reminds us of the high quality of this long defunct publication, as well as an unusually divided decade, marked by financial prosperity for many, but a simmering anger among blacks, women and non-conformist young people that would explode in the 1960s. The book shows how the dominance of advertising-based TV during the 1950s made most of the programming bland and reflective primarily of the white populace that did so well during the post-World War II era. The beautifully designed 235-page book reflects the diversity of LOOK with pictures of TV stars like Milton Berle and Lucille Ball in action, along with haunting images of poor ghetto dwellers and &#x201c;whites only&#x201d; restaurants and bathrooms in the South.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>CT Post Blog<br><br></i>&#x201c;...photos taken for Look magazine let you travel back in time considering: Was life easier, harder, or the same for women in the 50s as compared to their modern sisters?&#x201d; <i>&#x2013;Readers Digest</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;From the pages and archives of <i>LOOK</i> magazine, a publication that defined the Fifties...this handsome photographic celebration of the complicated, often contradictory era that transformed America&#x2019;s identity...an era that wasn&#x2019;t quite as simple as it might seem.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>American Profile</i></p><h2>The Acropolis: Through its Museum</h2><p>The Acropolis through its Museum is not simply a guidebook to the Acropolis Museum. By presenting the works of art exhibited in the museum, it endeavours to resynthesize the history of the Sacred Rock as part of the cultural and the wider historical process of Athens. The book follows the visitor&#39;s tour of the museum, so that the reader can study and learn more about the antiquities he sees before him. However, it is written is such a way that through independent inquiry the reader is able to approach the subjects more deeply and to understand the preconditions - political, social, economic, ideological, artistic and technological - that led to the creation of the unique monuments on the Acropolis. The book is lavishly illustrated with photographs, as well as numerous plans and reconstruction drawings, which enable the reader to understand each of the fragmentarily preserved works in its context. It also answers many of the questions raised in the discerning reader&#39;s mind, such as what was the size and the population of ancient Athens, what is the meaning of the beasts represented on the large Archaic pediments, what do the Korai statues represent, why did the Erechtheion become so complex and what was the role of the Karyatids, why was the temple of Athena Nike built in the Ionic order, what led Pericles and his advisers to opt for the specific building programme and how were the major public works financed, why was it decided to place an Ionic frieze on the Doric Parthenon, what political messages were transmitted to Sparta through the sculptural decoration of the Parthenon, and so on. Authored by a university professor who has been involved with studying and teaching the Acropolis for over thirty years, the publication is of the impeccable artistic quality distinctive of books produced by KAPON Editions.</p><p>Panos Valavanis is Professor of Classical Archaeology at Athens University.</p><h2>The Evolution of Cajun and Creole Cuisine</h2><p>The best of traditional Cajun and Creole cuisine comes to life with an emphasis on the "new basics" in Louisiana. This book is the first of its kind to tell the 250-year-old history of Cajun and Creole cuisine. "The rich heritage of Louisiana cuisine had never been told in a more complete form with traditional recipes to carry the flavor of the Cajuns and Creoles into the &#x2018;90s," Folse said. Chef Folse provides the history behind each dish, adding depth to the inherent traditions of those who created them. More than 250 recipes are featured in this 352-page cookbook.</p><p>Here in South Louisiana, the evolution process can be witnessed at every turn. This evolution is brought about when new ingredients and ideas are introduced into a region. That culmination of knowledge is witnessed in the pages of The Evolution of Cajun and Creole Cuisine.</p><h2>Nathan Turner&#39;s American Style: Classic Design and Effortless Entertaining</h2><p>With a style that is accessible and chic, Nathan Turner's aesthetic is Nate Berkus meets Colin Cowie and <i>Domino Magazine</i>.

It can be traditional or contemporary, new or old, French, English, Spanish, Italian, Shingle, or Shaker, but the architecture always drives the design direction for me. I am comfortable working with any style, and am always an advocate for the architect and for having an architect create a house that will be true to a style's traditions. <br><br>I invariably encourage clients to take the time to &#x201c;get the bones right.&#x201d; When I speak of &#x201c;bones,&#x201d; I am referring to the actual structure, the underlying configuration and shape of spaces and their placement in a house. When I walk through a house or read a new set of plans, I look for those bones, the skeletal strengths and weaknesses. And I look at the bones first, because for me, bones define potential.<br><br>I admit that I'm slightly obsessed with floor plans, and I love studying old plans from historic buildings. Floor plans reveal the inherent gracefulness of a house as well as the problems and possibilities of each space: where traffic flows and stops, whether moving a particular wall or widening a specific doorway will improve the quality of the space for the people living in it. I think about how to accentuate the positives and eliminate or diminish the negatives. Do the existing proportions work? Will altering structural elements such as walls or doorways improve the flow of the room? The house? People often think it's easier to remodel than to start from scratch, but remodeling frequently entails stricter challenges and tighter boundaries: in a sixteenth-floor apartment for example, the exterior walls are usually not negotiable. In contrast, it is often easy to get carried away with the seemingly limitless possibilities presented by building a new house-bigger is not necessarily better. <br><br>Floor plans must suit both the architecture of the house and the people who inhabit it. Planning with function in mind is essential to create a balanced, fluid, harmonious, and comfortable house. While aesthetic and stylistic considerations are important, function must come first, in every space. Years ago I was working on a house where the master bedroom had multiple windows and doors on all four walls. All those windows were lovely, but with so many punctures in the wall planes, placing furniture became a challenge. A simple action resolved the problem: a large single window centered on the longest wall was removed, creating a landing spot for the bed. It was replaced with two new flanking windows, which maintained the room's architectural balance and still satisfied the client's desire for several exposures. <br><br>Once structural bones are set, I turn to architectural details. Does the style suggest clean, contemporary lines, with simple moldings or no moldings at all? Are the corners sharp or eased? Does the residence contain any elements of architectural or historical significance that should be preserved or enhanced? If so, I'll campaign to keep them. I once worked on a San Francisco apartment with original interiors designed by Julia Morgan. It was suggested that smoothing over Morgan's plaster tracery ceiling would make necessary electrical work easier and cheaper. Horrified by the idea, I simply had to say no&#x2014;with no further discussion allowed. The ceiling won! Good bones should always be preserved, and they will ensure that architecture remains distinctive, original, and appropriate.</p><h2>Surrealism (World of Art)</h2><p><p><strong>"An excellent picture of a movement which...has had a profound effect on the arts of the twentieth century."&#x2015;<em>The Times Educational Supplement</em></strong></p> The character of Surrealism had been crystallizing over the previous five years when, in 1924, Andre Breton's Manifeste du Surrealisme defined the word. As conceived in those early days it was not so much a formal movement as a spiritual orientation, embracing ethics and politics as well as the arts. Recourse to dreams, to the unconscious, to chance factors, to automatism dictated the Surrealist mode. Patrick Waldberg prefaces this collection of key documents with an overview of Surrealism from its beginnings to the present time. 197 illustrations, 8 in color</p><p>Patrick Waldberg (1913-1985) was a American surrealist poet and the first biographer of Max Ernst. Born in Santa Monica, he was educated in France.&#x201c;Waldberg sensibly gives the bulk of his space to the actual documents of the movement&#x2015;the manifestos, the editorials, the outcries. Breton, Desnos, Eluard, Aragon, Ernst&#x2015;these and others are represented. The pictorial documentation is even more lavish&#x2015;here are all the major figures connected with the movement, 'taken from the life,' often by the perceptive camera of Man Ray.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Listener</em></strong></p><h2>Opera Cat</h2><p>From a brand-new author-illustrator team comes a humorous, heartwarming story about a special relationship between a cat and her owner. Alma the cat lives with Madame SoSo, an opera diva. When Madame rehearses, Alma softly sings along. Madame doesn&#x2019;t know Alma&#x2019;s secret&#x2014;in fact, she doesn&#x2019;t pay Alma much attention at all. But on the night of the big performance, Madame comes down with laryngitis . . . and at last Alma is given a chance to prove she is no ordinary animal. Accompanied by vivid, detail-filled illustrations, this story will resonate with anyone&#x2014;feline or human&#x2014;who has ever longed for a moment in the spotlight.</p><p>Tess Weaver is the author of Opera Cat and Cat Jumped In! She lives in Iowa City, Iowa. For more information visit www.tessweaver.com.In first-timer Weaver's exuberant tale, a quiet cat on an ordinary Saturday gets her moment in the sun. Each day, Alma hides behind the window curtains and practices along with her Italian opera singer owner. Wesson's (Not Just Another Moose) energetic black line and watercolor wash in velvety tones of aqua and scarlet capture the intensity of the Milan streets. From her window, Alma watches a mother fish her son out of a fountain while passersby purchase flowers, bread and other treats from shops along a cobblestone street. How the feline yearns to leave her apartment and experience the Milan outside her window! On opening night of the opera, Madame SoSo contracts laryngitis, and Alma sees her chance. The cat begins singing, and "Madame SoSo had never heard anything so lovely, so beautiful... [a voice] so much like her own!" Readers may guess the denouement, but that doesn't detract from the fun. Wesson's illustrations show the feline tucked into the diva's wig as she takes the stage, then scenes of the inseparable duo as they gallivant about town. Madame cuts a ridiculous figure early in the story, but redeems herself by warmly acknowledging Alma's role in her stage triumph. A delightful star-is-born story.

In its Hindi form of <i>jangal,</i> it denotes any area of uncultivated land. Indian jungles are not necessarily forested, and today less so than ever. But well away from centres of population there do still survive a few extensive and well-wooded jungle tracts, especially in eastern and central India. Often they are classed as game sanctuaries, a designation which implies few facilities for the visitor but some much-advertised protection for the wildlife.</p><p>Here tigers and elephants yet roam, hornbills flap about in the canopy like clumsy pterodactyls, and hump-backed boar rootle aggressively through the leaf mould. In the dry season a safari might seem an attractive prospect. But be warned: 'dry' is high-baked. Like splintering glass, dead leaves explode underfoot to alert the animals. The tracks of crumbled dirt are hard to follow, spiked with ferocious thorns, and spanned by man-size webs patrolled by bird-size spiders.</p><p>The wet season is worse still. Then, the vegetation erupts. The tracks become impassable, and the air fills with insects. Only fugitives take to the jungle in the monsoon. Fugitives and, in days gone by when maps were rare, surveyors. In the year 1819, in just such a tract between the Godavari and Kistna rivers in what is now the south-eastern state of Andhra Pradesh, an English Lieutenant, lately attached to the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India and uncommonly keen to make his mark, underwent a baptism of fever.</p><p>Matters had gone badly for the twenty-eight-year-old Lieutenant from the start. Barely a month into this, his first season in the field, he had been confronted by a mutiny. 'The infliction of corporal punishment is an odious task,' he noted. But it was either that or abandoning the assignment. His escort obviously knew the perils of the monsoonal jungle and had seized every chance of escaping from the camp back to the city of Hyderabad. Something had to be done. Not without misgivings, the Lieutenant ordered one of these defaulters to be thrashed, whereupon the whole troop, about forty in number, took up their weapons and announced that they would decamp <i>en masse.</i> The British bluff had been called; in this insignificant and still today unfashionable comer of the subcontinent the myth of empire was at stake.</p><p>As might be inferred, by 18 19 the British were already well on their way to becoming masters of India. Some areas had been won by conquest and were now under direct British rule; others were merely attached by treaty and remained nominally independent states under their own rulers. This was the case with the large principality of Hyderabad, through whose densest jungle the Kistna and Godavari rivers converged on the coast. Special permission had been obtained for the Great Trigonometrical Survey to operate in Hyderabad; but in 'a native state' the standards of subservience exacted in areas under direct British rule could not be taken for granted.</p><p>In fact, they could seemingly not be taken at all other than at the point of a gun. The mutineers, who now repaired to the nearby shade of a mango orchard, comprised a detachment of local troops lent by Nizam Sikander Jah of Hyderabad to protect and assist the British survey. In addition, the Survey had its own escort of twelve men who had been recruited in British territory, were paid out of the Survey's budget and had already amassed many years of loyal service. This in-house escort was now ordered to load muskets and take aim at the mutineers. A volley into their midst was threatened if they did not immediately surrender.</p><p>The ploy worked. The mutineers submitted, and this time the Lieutenant offered no apology for calling for the cane. Three men were publicly flogged, then dismissed; and thus, the Lieutenant tells us, 'was settled, very early in my career, a disputed point which had been a source of constant contention and annoyance to Colonel Lambton ever since his entering into the Nizam's territory'.</p><p>Colonel Lambton was the originator and now Superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. For seventeen years he had been spinning a web of giant geometry across the Indian peninsula without ever having had to thrash any of its teeming peoples. Tactful, patient and indestructible, Lambton seemed immune to India's frustrations, the result of a long wilderness experience in North America and of an attachment to science so obsessive and disinterested that even his critics were inclined to indulge him. Colonel Lambton beguiled India; but Lieutenant George Everest, his eager new assistant, chastised it.</p><p>The name, incidentally, was pronounced not 'Ever-rest' (like 'cleverest'), but 'Eve-rest' (like 'cleave-rest'). That was how the family always pronounced it, and the Lieutenant would not have thanked you for getting it wrong. Years later a fellow officer would make the mistake of calling him a 'Kumpass Wala'. No offence was meant. 'Kumpass Wala', or 'compass-wallah', was an accepted Anglo-Indian term for a surveyor. Everest, however, accepted nothing of the sort. He detested what he called 'nicknames' and, though it was not perhaps worth a dawn challenge, he demanded -- and received -- abject apologies. Getting on the wrong side of George Everest was an occupational hazard with which even British India would only slowly come to terms.</p><p>With the mutiny quelled and the mutineers 'finding that, when they knew me better, good behaviour was a perfect security against all unkindness', a self-righteous Everest pressed on for the jungles beside the Kistna. It was July, the month when the monsoon breaks. On time, the heavens duly opened just as he climbed a hill to his first observation post.</p><p>Survey work was conducted during and immediately after the monsoon because, regardless of the discomfort, it was only then that the dust was laid and the heat-haze dispersed. In the interludes of bright sunshine, the atmosphere was at its clearest. . .</p></p><h2>Marina Carr: Plays 1: Low in the Dark, The Mai, Portia Coughlan, By the Bog of Cats...

Ms. Mitchell lives and works in Tucson, AZ.The immune system is a scapegoat for a variety of ills in this wide-ranging but tendentious guide to approaching diseases like lupus, Crohn's disease, MS, and rheumatoid arthritis. The author argues that autoimmune disorders, in which a malfunctioning immune system attacks healthy tissues, are caused or triggered by environmental toxins, especially heavy metals and free radicals. Drawing on his experience treating patients for the above disorders as well as chronic fatigue syndrome and autism, he recommends a variety of unconventional regimens to purge toxins from our bodies and surroundings, including chelation therapy, herb, vitamin and anti-oxidant supplements, an organic diet free of additives and allergens, sauna and massage, and the systematic use of air and water filters. Edelson provides detailed information in chapters covering specific autoimmune disorders, but his claims of a "fantastic" treatment record for some of them rely on anecdotal case studies of diseases that sometimes go into spontaneous remission. By the tenets of "clinical molecular medicine," he claims, "I don't need to know the specific autoimmune disorder a patient has, because the label doesn't matter." Since no specific disease label need be applied, such widespread and indeterminate "symptoms" as "fatigue," "depression," "muscle and joint pain," "frustration," "sparse hair," "brain fog" and "general malaise" can be construed as signs of the immune dysfunction. While this book offers information on conventional treatments and physicians, its orientation is decidedly elsewhere. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Miss Pickerell Goes to the Arctic</h2><p>Miss Pickerell travels to the Arctic by snowmobile to rescue several scientists</p><p></p><h2>The Clan Almanac: A Complete Guide to Scottish Family Names</h2><p>A guide to Scotland&#39;s family heritage provides information on the origin of the name, the lands, principal branches, slogan, leading figures, and tartan for each clan discussed</p><p></p><h2>Ronin: The Deluxe Edition</h2><p>RONIN is the acclaimed epic by Frank Miller, the visionary writer/artist of THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, 300 and Sin City.

Richly textured with bits of her own childhood and married life with her husband, John Gregory Dunne, and daughter, Quintana Roo, this new book by Joan Didion examines her thoughts, fears, and doubts regarding having children, illness, and growing old.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Blue Nights</i> opens on July 26, 2010, as Didion thinks back to Quintana&#x2019;s wedding in New York seven years before. <i>Today would be her wedding anniversary.</i> This fact triggers vivid snapshots of Quintana&#x2019;s childhood&#x2014;in Malibu, in Brentwood, at school in Holmby Hills. Reflecting on her daughter but also on her role as a parent, Didion asks the candid questions any parent might about how she feels she failed either because cues were not taken or perhaps displaced. &#x201c;How could I have missed what was clearly there to be seen?&#x201d; Finally, perhaps we all remain unknown to each other. Seamlessly woven in are incidents Didion sees as underscoring her own age, something she finds hard to acknowledge, much less accept.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Blue Nights</i>&#x2014;the long, light evening hours that signal the summer solstice, &#x201c;the opposite of the dying of the brightness, but also its warning&#x201d;&#x2014;like <i>The Year of Magical Thinking</i> before it, is an iconic book of incisive and electric honesty, haunting and profoundly moving.</p><p><b>Joan Didion</b> was born in Sacramento, California, and now lives in New York City. She is the author of five novels and eight previous books of nonfiction. Her collected nonfiction, <i>We Tell Ourselves Stories in Order to Live, </i>was published by Everyman's Library in 2006.<i>In certain latitudes there comes a span of time approaching and following the summer solstice, some weeks in all, when the twilights turn long and blue. This period of the blue nights does not occur in subtropical California, where I lived for much of the time I will be talking about here and where the end of daylight is fast and lost in the blaze of the dropping sun, but it does occur in New York, where I now live. You notice it first as April ends and May begins, a change in the season, not exactly a warming&#x2014;in fact not at all a warming&#x2014;yet suddenly summer seems near, a possibility, even a promise. You pass a window, you walk to Central Park, you find yourself swimming in the color blue: the actual light is blue, and over the course of an hour or so this blue deepens, becomes more intense even as it darkens and fades, approximates finally the blue of the glass on a clear day at Chartres, or that of the Cerenkov radiation thrown off by the fuel rods in the pools of nuclear reactors. The French called this time of day &#x201c;l&#x2019;heure bleue.&#x201d; To the English it was &#x201c;the gloaming.&#x201d; The very word &#x201c;gloaming&#x201d; reverberates, echoes&#x2014; the gloaming, the glimmer, the glitter, the glisten, the glamour&#x2014;carrying in its consonants the images of houses shuttering, gardens darkening, grass-lined rivers slipping through the shadows. During the blue nights you think the end of day will never come. As the blue nights draw to a close (and they will, and they do) you experience an actual chill, an apprehension of illness, at the moment you first notice: the blue light is going, the days are already shortening, the summer is gone. This book is called &#x201c;Blue Nights&#x201d; because at the time I began it I found my mind turning increasingly to illness, to the end of promise, the dwindling of the days, the inevitability of the fading, the dying of the brightness.<br><br>Blue nights are the opposite of the dying of the brightness, but they are also its warning.</i><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The Illustrated History of the American Railroad</h2><p>3 VOLUME BOXED HARDCOVER W/ DJ SET IN SLIPCASE, EACH 127 PP,: 1.

Born in 1894 into a poor Maryland family, Hammett left school at fourteen and held several jobs before joining the Pinkerton National Detective Agency as an operative in 1915 and, with time off in 1918 to serve at the end of World War I, he remained with the agency until 1922, participating alike in the banal and dramatic action of an operative. The tuberculosis he contracted during the war forced him to leave the Pinkertons--but it may well have prompted one of America's most acclaimed writing careers.</p><p>While Hammett's life on center stage has been well-documented, the question of how he got there has not. That largely overlooked phase is the subject of Nathan Ward's enthralling <i>The Lost Detective</i>. Hammett's childhood, his life in San Francisco, and especially his experience as a detective deeply informed his writing and his characters, from the nameless Continental Op, hero of his stories and early novels, to Sam Spade and Nick Charles. The success of his many stories in the pulp magazine <i>Black Mask </i>following his departure from the Pinkertons led him to novels; he would write five between 1929 and 1934, two of them (<i>The Maltese Falcon</i> and <i>The Thin Man</i>) now American classics. Though he inspired generations of writers, from Chandler to Connelly and all in between, after <i>The Thin Man</i> he never finished another book, a painful silence for his devoted readers; and his popular image has long been shaped by the remembrance of Hellman, who knew him after his literary reputation had been made. Based on original research across the country, <i>The Lost Detective</i> is the first book to illuminate Hammett's transformation from real detective to great American detective writer, throwing brilliant new light on one of America's most celebrated and remembered novelists and his world.</p></p><p><b>Nathan Ward</b> is the author of <i>Dark Harbor: The War for the New York Waterfront</i>. He was an editor at <i>American Heritage</i>, and he has written for the<i> New York Times</i> and other publications. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.<p>&#x201c;Funny thing about books, some of them are a delight and a pleasure. Thus Nathan Ward's <i>The Lost Detective</i>--yes it's very well-written, yes the history is carefully done, but it has that glow. So, this you will like.&#x201d; &#x2015;Alan Furst, author of MIDNIGHT IN EUROPE</p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Lost Detective</i> humanizes my grandfather, while at the same time illuminating the context of his life and times. Links between Hammett&#x2019;s fiction and Pinkertons and his early (pre-Hellman) family life are particularly satisfying.&#x201d; &#x2015;Julie M. Rivett, co-editor of SELECTED LETTERS OF DASHIELL HAMMETT and THE HUNTER AND OTHER STORIES</p><p>&#x201c;As a devoted Hammett aficionado, I&#x2019;ve read most books about him and published his daughter&#x2019;s memoir, but learned so much in this captivating examination of the great author&#x2019;s life that I feel compelled to reread his complete works with far deeper understanding than ever before.&#x201d; &#x2015;Otto Penzler, Editor, THE BEST AMERICAN NOIR OF THE CENTURY</p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Lost Detective </i>is full of stimulating insight into how the novice writer shaped real-life experience into vital fiction.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Ward's focus on the origins of Hammett's writing style and his connecting the events of the author's background to the fiction are the highlights of this brief, accessible biography . . . Highly recommended.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;As brisk and conversational as a magazine feature, <i>The Lost Detective</i> invites readers not just to explore Hammett's early years in more detail and consider how those formative experiences helped shape his writing career, but also . . . to look at how the Hammett persona was created. And as we Hammett fans know, there are few personas, few writers in 20th-century literature period, more interesting to read about.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Washington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;A gritty portrait of the 20th century's great pulp poet Dashiell Hammett, who turned his days gumshoeing for the Pinkerton Detective Agency into bawdy and muscular American classics.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>O, the Oprah Magazine</i></p><p>&#x201c;[H]ighly entertaining . . . captures what it feels like to read Hammett's early work and, as Ward says, 'watch a sickly ex-detective in his late twenties, with an eighth-grade education, gradually, improbably, teach himself to write.'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Boston Globe</i></p><p>&#x201c;Nathan Ward shows that Hammett's innovative style did not, as it may have seemed, spring fully formed like Athena from the head of Zeus . . . With deft investigative work, Ward shows how much of Hammett's fiction owed to Pinkerton reports . . . a lively, witty account of how Hammett came to be Hammett--a portrait of the artist, if you will, as a cynical man.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><p>&#x201c;[A] splendid biography of this keystone figure of American letters. Fittingly, there have been numerous biographies of Hammett . . . but none have explored as deeply his life before he became a writer. There can be little doubt that Hammett&#x2019;s work with the Pinkertons was the greatest influence on who he became, both as a person and as an author . . . Ward wisely chose to focus on Hammett&#x2019;s formative years.&#x201d; &#x2015;Otto Penzler in THE NATIONAL REVIEW</p><p>&#x201c;Nathan Ward&#x2019;s book shines a detective's flashlight on Hammett's early development.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Buffalo News</i></p><p>&#x201c;Hardboiled crime novel fans will find Ward's research into what it meant to Hammett to be an actual detective before he wrote about them quite fascinating.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>ShelfAwareness</i></p><p>"With its sharp focus and strong hook, <i>The Lost Detective </i>is a fascinating read [that] casts Hammett in a new and intriguing light." &#x2015;<i>Herald Scotland</i></p><p><i>"</i>Investigative biographer Nathan Ward brings those offstage influences alive in <i>The Lost Detective: Becoming Dashiell Hammett</i> . . .

It looks at the theories of major minds of the twentieth-century Right, including Carl Schmitt, Leo Strauss and Friedrich von Hayek; liberal philosophers such as John Rawls, Jurgen Habermas and Norberto Bobbio; and significant figures in the culture of the Left: the historians Edward Thompson, Robert Brenner and Eric Hobsbawm; the classicist Sebastiano Timpanaro; the sociologist Goran Therborn; the novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez. The book concludes with some comparative observations on the two leading intellectual periodicals of the UK and USA, the <i>London Review of Books</i> and <i>New York Review of Books</i>; and a piece of family history.</p><p><b>Perry Anderson</b> is the author of, among other books, <i>Spectrum, Lineages of the Absolutist State, Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism, Considerations on Western Marxism, English Questions, The Origins of Postmodernity</i>, and <i>The New Old World</i>. He teaches history at UCLA and is on the editorial board of <i>New Left Review</i>.What are the meanings, boundaries and relevance of the categories Right, Center, and Left in our world's current political climate? In this book, Anderson-the eminent historian and former editor of New Left Review-takes a "panning shot" across the modern intellectual landscape, critically examining these issues in 15 essays, 14 of which were previously published in The London Review of Books or New Left Review. Anderson possesses both a magisterial intelligence and an abstruse vocabulary, which can make his work appear unapproachable to even the most erudite readers. However, one of Anderson's central themes is refreshingly simple: he continually echoes Carl Schmitt's claim that "dividing friend from foe...is the opposition that defines the nature of the political as such." This concept is illustrated most clearly in essays on "the Center," such as when Anderson demarcates Timothy Garton Ash's allegiances to Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia as compared to the rest of "Eastern Europe." In effect, everyone has to come down on one side of the political fence at some point. Through the lens of this binary opposition, Anderson appraises a gamut of philosophers, political theorists and writers of various subgenres, wielding both his sharp intellect and pen to elucidate-and rebuke-their ideas. Although Anderson's own far-left political views are occasionally visible, he creates a successful overview of contemporary intellectual thought, reinforcing the idea that all life inevitably revolves around politics.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

To try to break through the opposing lines of trenches and barbed wire entanglements, both sides employed huge artillery bombardments followed by attacks by tens of thousands of soldiers. Battles could last for months and led to casualties measured in hundreds of thousands for attacker and defender alike. After most of these attacks, only a short section of the front would have moved and only by a kilometer or two. After Gallipoli, Australians were moved to fight in France on the western Front, in battles including the Battle of the Somme. On the first day of the 1916 Battle of the Somme, 60,000 Allies were casualties, including 20,000 deaths. The principal adversaries on the Western Front, who fielded armies of millions of men, were Germany to the East against a western alliance to the West consisting of France and the United Kingdom with sizable contingents from the British Empire, especially the Dominions. The United States entered the war in 1917 and by the summer of 1918 had an army of around half a million men which rose to a million by the time the Armistice was signed on November 11, 1918. For most of World War I, Allied Forces, predominantly those of France and the British Empire, were stalled at trenches on the Western Front. With the aid of numerous black and white and color photographs, many previously unpublished, the World War I series recreates the battles and campaigns that raged across the surface of the globe, on land, at sea and in the air.

Pieces of red coloured material known as the 'Red Tabs' and worn on the epaulettes of their uniforms, denoted that each one was a volunteer. They pushed the Italian forces out of East Africa and then faced Hitler's Afrika Korps in the Western Desert. During a little known battle, at a stretch of desert called Acroma Keep, South African troops held their ground against overwhelming odds. Amidst the action a truce was held between the Germans and the South Africans. It lasted long enough to gather the wounded and the dead. Thereafter, the fighting recommenced. Acroma Keep became the last defensive position to fall, before Rommel's forces attacked Tobruk. Ultimately at Tobruk the German army took 33,000 prisoners.

Far from being a fashion dinosaur, an outmoded, cumbersome relic from a former age, it is now recognised again as the most flattering and versatile form of jewellery; and is enjoying a style revival.<br>Tiaras have always epitomised majesty, romance and glamour, whether worn by a queen or empress at a state occasion, by a princess as part of her bridal trousseau, or flaunted by a star or supermodel at the latest celebrity party. In Tiaras Past and Present Geoffrey Munn traces the history of these magnificent jewels from ancient times to their re-emergence in the First Empire, through the work of Faberge, Cartier and Boucheron to the extravagant creations of designers like Versace today. Tiaras of all types glitter throughout these pages, from royal diadems set with precious stones, literally breathtaking in their beauty, to the punk-rock acrylic tiara of Vivienne Westwood, and stunning contemporary creations by David Linley, PhilipTreacy and Jan Yager.

Psychiatrist and mother Robin Burman&#39;s brilliant new book shows you the way: Hate Me Now, Thank Me Later is the definitive guide to helping your child grow with both love and discipline. Whilst in years gone by children were seen and not heard, too often nowadays their every whim and tantrum is pandered to. As much as the former is unthinkable, the latter can also be damaging to a child&#39;s later life: over praised children allowed to set their own limits often become anxious and are unable to deal with the negative emotions they will eventually encounter. Hate Me Now, Thank Me Later finds the perfect balance between the outdated old and the unfortunate new. Through helpful guidance based on Robin&#39;s extensive experience as both a certified psychiatrist and mother, it will teach you to be comfortable setting boundaries whilst maintaining a loving connection; fostering confidence, respect and emotional maturity in your child as a result. Packed with practical advice alongside plenty of sympathetic anecdotes, Hate Me Now, Thank Me Later is the warm, relatable guide to parenting which you can come back to again and again.

Written with an unprecedented realism that challenged the romanticism of previous maritime literature, Dana&#x2019;s narrative vividly portrays the daily routines and hardships of life at sea, the capriciousness and brutality of merchant ship captains and officers, and the beauty and danger of the southern oceans in winter. Included in an appendix is &#x201c;Twenty-Four Years After&#x201d; (1869), in which Dana describes his return to California in 1859&#x2013;1860 and the immense changes brought about by American annexation, the frenzy of the Gold Rush, and the growing commerce of &#x201c;a new world, the awakened Pacific.&#x201d;<br><br>Dana first visited Cuba in the winter of 1859 while the possible annexation of the island was being debated in the U.S. Senate.&nbsp;<i>To Cuba and Back</i>&nbsp;(1859) is his entertaining and enthusiastic account of his trip, during which he toured Havana and a sugar plantation; attended a bullfight; visited churches, hospitals, schools, and prisons; and investigated the impact on Cuban society of slavery and autocratic Spanish rule.<br><br><i>Journal of a Voyage Round the World, 1859&#x2013;1860</i>&nbsp;records the fourteen-month circumnavigation that took Dana to California, Hawaii, China, Japan, Malaya, Ceylon, India, Egypt, and Europe. Written with unflagging energy and curiosity, the journal provides fascinating vignettes of frontier life in California, missionary influence in Hawaii, the impact of the Taiping Rebellion and the Second Opium War on China, and the opening of Japan to the West, while capturing the transition from the age of sail to the faster, smaller world created by the steamship and the telegraph.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

He describes her articles for the New Yorker on the Adolf Eichmann trial in the 1960s and how they provoked sharp criticism from New York's Jewish community. May also deftly examines Arendt's early environment and provides insightful glimpses into her personal life. For instance, Arendt's experience in France in the 1930s as a refugee from Nazi Germany was at the core of her later, passionate writing about the desperation of the stateless person in society. He also portrays her independent spirit and gives accounts of her two marriages and several love affairs, including one with Martin Heidegger, the existentialist philosopher and her professor in Germany.

At that time, the Union consisted of Tonkin, Annam, Laos, Cambodia, and Cochin-China. Michael Kaponya shares his memoirs as a French Foreign Legionnaire who served in the infantry and participated in battles and countless skirmishes between 1949 and 1952 in Indochina.

Original.</p><p>Although this anthology of 16 short stories edited by Rod Serling's widow promises new excursions into what he called "a place between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge," the reader is instead transported into ennui. Unlike the best of the original Twilight Zone television episodes, the majority of these tales lack dramatic impact. Alan Dean Foster writes of a construction project in the Australian Outback that just can't be finished--a national highway that crumbles to dust only hours after it is laid. The futility of the crew's labor is matched only by that of the reader's attempt to find coherence in this aimless tale. W. Warren Wagar's story about a future in which a healthy diet is legally enforced by food police tickles a bit but contains no real laughs. Even the story by Rod Serling himself--about a cocktail-party game of hypnotism gone awry--seems out of date and sexist: the hostess is described as being "on the broad-hipped side of thirty," with "legs by Steinway." Serling's witty dialogue remains potent, but the obvious plot overshadows any possible sense of irony. This is one journey best left untraveled. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.From Jane M.

While it does give a firsthand account of the birth of The Body Shop and Roddick's own particular leadership style of creative (and sometimes chaotic) passion, it doubles as a clarion call for business to tackle the big issues of life alongside the pursuit of profits, with heart, soul and conscience. <p> Roddick grew up in a large Italian immigrant family in small town in blue-collar England, where she was instilled with an intense work ethic and an irreverent, entrepreneurial spirit. Though she admits to having opened her first Body Shop as a way to make ends meet, Roddick developed the company around her zealous belief that, since there is "no more powerful institution in society than business ... it is more important than ever before for business to assume a moral leadership in society." Her concern for protecting the environment and indigenous people's cultures, and of seeing all of life as interconnected, have directed the growth of the company and inspired much of this book. Her account moves from an initial description of what she sees as the problem with "business as usual," through a history of The Body Shop as illustrating her philosophies on fostering passionate activism, building community, making it as a woman, and succeeding in business. Though Roddick's tone occasionally lapses into what might be interpreted as a rather self-righteous one (particularly in her references to most of the company's competition as merely "imitation"), it is driven by a feisty belief in her ideals. The chapter that describes The Body Shop launch into the U.S. market and its subsequent problems with intense competition is not exactly an American love-fest, but for those readers on this side of the Atlantic who don't take themselves too seriously, it's an informative and often amusing take on the trials of cross-cultural marketing. While praise of The Body Shop's good deeds to date is woven into much of what she discusses, Roddick is not afraid of being honest. Indeed, she presents some of the company's less flattering underbelly, such as a failed experiment in trading directly with an indigenous tribe and the unsuccessful "reorganization" of the company by an unresearched external consultant, which is far more daring than most business leaders are in discussing their corporate offspring. The book would have benefited from a more detailed and less defensive presentation of the media storm that surrounded the company from 1992 to 1994 (which comes dangerously close to being a diatribe), but Roddick's conversational writing style--extremely effective in relaying fervent dedication--doesn't leave room for a lot of legal analysis. </p><p> This is an entertaining read with a serious message, a lilting and somewhat whimsical manifesto. Not merely the story of one woman's pursuit of business success and the history and philosophy of The Body Shop, it is an invigorating guidebook for anyone eager to marry an entrepreneurial, principled spirit with a keen sense of social justice. --<i>S.

Simplistic and not on par with similar published remembrances from El Salvador and Nicaragua&#34;--Handbook of Latin American Studies, v. 58.</p><p>Jennifer Harbury is a human rights attorney, author of Bridge of Courage (Common Courage 1993) and Searching for Everardo (Warner 1997). Her husband, Efrain Bamaca Velasquez, was abducted by the Guatemalan military in 1992. Her efforts to save his life resulted in disclosures by U.S. officials confirming his torture and murder by Guatemalan officers serving as paid CIA informants.Author's Note<br> Who are the Guatemalan revolutionaries? What minds and hearts make up the organizations of the entity called the Unidad Revolucionaria Natcional Guatemalteca, the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union (URNG)? What do they want? What do they think? How do they behave? Do people support them? Magazines, television, and newspapers in the United States reveal little about Guatemala and nothing about the compa-eros themselves. Not surprisingly, the various Latin American revolutions begin to blur together in the consciousness of the U.S. public. In the absence of concrete information, the image of a guerrilla emerges in foggy and stereotypical form, young and a bit macho, idealistic yet dogmatic, jaunty in a beret and dangerously armed. <p>In the early 1980s, I began to work with Guatemalan refugees who fled the terror of their country. To find supporting evidence for their political asylum applications, I traveled to Mexico gathering information and testimonies, visiting church organization, and interviewing people at the refugee camps. Later, I moved to Guatemala itself. The human devastation that I witnessed is well documented in the annals of Amnesty International, in the regular reports of Americas Watch, and the denouncements of the Catholic Church. This book does not attempt to repeat the documentation. Rather, it attempts to tell a part of the story that, for many reasons, has always been concealed. </p><p>During my years in Guatemala, I came to know many people involved in the underground, in the revolution. They were men and women, old and young, professors and peasants, civil rights workers and Mayan villagers. Some are still living but many are now dead, either killed in combat or hunted down in the city streets. In the years since I was forced to leave the country, my contact with these revolutionaries has remained strong. I have come to know more and more of them, as individuals and as friends. To keep them safe from harm, the details of my connections and relationships with them can never be told-at least not until this terrible war had ended. But we know each other well and see each other with great frequency. For me, it has been a privilege. </p><p>This book is an anthology, a collection of oral histories. Throughout the years, there have been many difficult times, but also quiet times, opportunities to talk, swap stories, ask about each other's lives and dreams. I have written down those stories, just as they were told to me. For the sake of accuracy, I have included only accounts that were given to me first hand, and by people I have come to know personally. I have also included excerpts from the journal I kept during my time in Guatemala. </p><p>The stories are divided into four categories: Part I gives accounts about how and why people made the difficult and dangerous decision to work for their revolution; Part II describes earlier stages of the war, of condition, hardships and battles in the early 1980s; Part III includes accounts and descriptions of present day life in the struggle, the changes made and the hopes for the future; Part IV discusses projects people can get involved with to change their plight. I have changed the names and places and other identifying details. I want this book to cause no deaths. Three of the stories are composites of several similar stories, blended together to avoid repetition. No other changes have been made. None of the people or the events is fictitious. </p><p>These are the stories of people I have come, through the years, to love and respect.

And each one is her favorite." At age 99, Miss Fannie has much history--and even more hats. She was wearing her green velour hat when she witnessed a terrible flood in 1916. Her wide-brimmed felt hat with the gleaming black feather reminds her of the hawk she caught to keep it from killing her hens and biddies. But her pink straw hat with silk roses truly is her favorite. For 35 years she's worn this hat to church every Easter Sunday, and "it always makes her feel brand-new, like Easter itself." She's not the only one who thinks it's special. When her handsome young preacher asks her to donate a hat to the church auction, Miss Fannie knows what she has to do. She takes a deep breath, thinks of her favorite verse from the Bible, "With God, all things are possible," and wraps up her pink straw hat. But she doesn't realize just how much <i>is</i> possible until the Easter Sunday after the auction.<p> Jan Kuron, popular author of the bestselling series for adults, <i>The Mitford Years</i>, as well as the children's book, <i>Jeremy: The Tale of an Honest Bunny</i>, crafts a pleasing story of a charming woman (based on Kuron's own grandmother) who reaps the sweet rewards of her generosity.

Cleopatra Robbins was definitely not the sort of woman he had been expecting to find.</p><p>Max stood quietly near the roaring fire and surveyed the chaos that filled the cozy lobby of the Robbins' Nest Inn. In spite of her evocative first name, Ms. Robbins certainly did not look like a sultry charmer who made her living by seducing wealthy men old enough to be her grandfather.</p><p>She looked exactly like what she purported to be: a cheerfully harried innkeeper trying to deal with a flood of new arrivals.</p><p>Max glanced at the series of insipid seascapes hanging on the walls as he listened to the hubbub going on around him. He smiled with faint derision. It was obvious that Cleopatra Robbins was not only not a typical seductress, she was not much of a connoisseur of art. Anyone who would hang those bland views of storm-tossed seas would be incapable of appreciating the five Amos Luttrell paintings that had been left in her care.</p><p>It was just as well she preferred the seascapes, because Max intended to take the Luttrells from her. They belonged to him. They constituted his inheritance from Jason Curzon, and Max had every intention of claiming them.</p><p>He was prepared to use whatever tactics were necessary to recover the legacy. Having to fight for what was his would be nothing new for Max. Since the age of six, he had done battle for everything he had ever wanted in life. Sometimes he lost, but more often he won.</p><p>Max rested both hands on the intricately carved hawk that formed the grip of his cane. With an effort of will that was second nature to him, he ignored the persistent ache in his leg. The old wound was acting up again tonight, bringing back memories he had no intention of indulging.</p><p>He concentrated instead on Cleopatra Robbins as she bustled about behind the front desk.</p><p>Max remembered that Jason had called her Cleo. The nickname suited her much better than the more dramatic Cleopatra.</p><p>Trust Jason to choose a mistress who did not fit the stereotype. But, then, Jason had always had a gift for looking beneath the surface. He'd had the discerning eye of an intuitive collector, a man who trusted his own instincts rather than the opinion of others. The stunning array of paintings he had bequeathed to his favorite art museum in Seattle bore testimony to his unerring taste. But the five Amos Luttrells had formed the centerpiece of his collection.</p><p>Curzon had owned close to two hundred paintings at the time of his death. As far as Max knew, Cleopatra Robbins was the only mistress Jason had ever collected.</p><p>An unexpected sense of wrongness rippled through Max as he tried to envision the woman behind the desk in bed with Jason Curzon. Jason was the closest thing Max had ever had to a father. He told himself he should have been glad that the old man had had some feminine companionship during the last year and a half of his life. God knew, Jason had had many lonely years after the death of his wife.</p><p>But for some reason Max didn't like the idea that the female providing that companionship had been Cleo Robbins.</p><p>Max concluded that she was somewhere in her late twenties, perhaps twenty-seven or twenty-eight. He studied her precariously listing topknot of thick, dark, auburn hair and found himself wondering what it would look like tumbled down around her shoulders. There was no particular style to the design of the topknot. The rich mass of hair had obviously been twisted into position in a hurry, anchored with a clip, and left to flounder under its own weight.</p><p>Instead of the exotic kohl her namesake might have used to outline her eyes, Cleo Robbins wore a pair of round, gold-framed glasses. Max realized that in an odd way they served the same purpose as elaborate makeup, concealing the real expression in her wide, hazel green eyes.</p><p>The lady he had been hunting for the past month looked out at the world with the professionally friendly gaze of a successful innkeeper, but he sensed something deeper and more compelling about her.</p><p>Max had an inexplicable urge to try something that he knew from experience rarely worked. He looked into Cleo Robbins the way he looked into a painting.</p><p>To his surprise, the commotion and noise around him receded, just as it did when he was transfixed by a work of art. The world and his focus narrowed to include only Cleo Robbins. He felt the familiar stirring deep inside himself almost immediately. It made him uneasy. He was accustomed to feeling this sense of fascination and longing only when he was in the presence of the things he collected.</p><p>Jason had told Max that the talent could be applied to people as well as art and books. But Max had discovered the hard way that the ability to see beneath the surface had its limits when it came to dealing with other human beings. People were more complex than art, and all too often they had an ability to hide the deeper truths about themselves.</p><p>Nevertheless, there was no denying the kick-in-the-gut feeling he was getting now as he studied Cleo with what Jason had called his inner eye.</p><p>"Just one moment, Mr. Partridge. I'll have someone take your luggage up to your room." Cleo gave the irritable-looking Mr. Partridge a spectacular smile as she banged the silver bell on the desk.</p><p>"About time," Partridge muttered. "Took me nearly three hours to get here from Seattle. Don't know why in hell the company had to pick an inn way out here on the coast for this damn fool motivational seminar. Could have held it at one of the big hotels in the city."</p><p>"I'm sure you'll find that at this time of year the Washington coast provides a wonderful setting for an educational retreat." Cleo glanced anxiously toward the staircase. "I'm afraid my bellhop is busy at the moment. I'll give you your key, and you can go on up to your room. I'll have the luggage brought up to you later, if you don't mind."</p><p>"Forget it. I'll carry it myself." Partridge snatched up the suitcase at his feet. "Can I at least get a drink somewhere around here?"</p><p>"An excellent selection of Northwest wines and beers is available in the lounge, Mr. Partridge."</p><p>"Damn. What I really need is a martini." Partridge snatched up his key and stalked toward the staircase. The next three people in line behind him surged forward in a wave.</p><p>Max watched as Cleo braced herself for the onslaught. He saw her glance again at the stairs. When the missing bellhop did not materialize there, she turned back to face the wave with a warm smile of welcome.</p><p>The lobby door slammed open with a crash. Max saw lightning crackle across the night sky. Rain, wind, and two more drenched inn patrons blew into the hall. They joined the crowd milling around in front of the hearth.</p><p>"Lucky Ducky go swimming."</p><p>Startled by the high, squeaky voice that came out of nowhere, Max looked down. A small boy with a head full of blond curls looked up at him. He was dressed in a miniature pair of jeans and a striped shirt. He appeared to be no more than five years old, and he had a thumb stuck in his mouth.</p><p>"I beg your pardon?" Max could not recall the last time he had conversed with a child.</p><p>The small boy yanked his thumb out of his mouth long enough to repeat his statement. "Lucky Ducky go swimming." Jamming his thumb back into his mouth, he gave Max an expectant look.</p><p>"I see." Max sought for a suitable response. "It's a cold night for swimming, isn't it?"</p><p>"Uncle Jason said ducks can swim anytime, anywhere."</p><p>Max's hands tightened around the hawk-headed grip of the cane. "Uncle Jason?"</p><p>"Uncle Jason's gone," the child confided with a wistful expression. "Cleo says he's in heaven."</p><p>"Jason Curzon in heaven?" Max contemplated that. "Well, anything's possible, I suppose."</p><p>"Did you know Uncle Jason?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>The boy took his thumb out of his mouth again and gave Max a bright, toothless smile. "My name is Sammy Gordon. Did you know my daddy, too?"</p><p>"I don't think so." A staggering thought occurred to Max. "Not unless your daddy was Uncle Jason?"</p><p>"No, no, no," the child said, clearly impatient. "My daddy isn't in heaven like Uncle Jason. My daddy's lost."</p><p>Max realized he was beginning to lose the thread of the conversation. "Lost?"</p><p>Sammy nodded quickly. "I heard Mommy tell Cleo that he had to go find himself."</p><p>"I see."</p><p>"He never did, I guess."</p><p>Max did not know what to say to that. He glanced across the crowded room and saw a pretty woman with short, honey-blond hair emerge from the office behind the front desk. She went to give Cleo a hand.</p><p>"That's my mommy," Sammy volunteered.</p><p>"What's her name?"</p><p>"Sylvia Gordon." Sammy eyed Max's cane with deep interest. "Why do you have to lean on that? Did you hurt yourself?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Will you be all better soon?"</p><p>"I hurt myself a long time ago," Max said. "This is as good as I'm going to get."</p><p>"Oh." Sammy was intrigued.</p><p>"Sammy?" Cleo came around from behind the desk. "Where are you?"</p><p>Max's head came up swiftly. Jason's mistress had a rich honey-and-cream sort of voice, perfectly suited to a Cleopatra. Another jolt of awareness went through him. He could almost hear that warm, sensual voice in bed.</p><p>"Here I am, Cleo." Sammy waved a wet thumb at her.</p><p>Max's eye was caught by a glimpse of silver as Cleo emerged from the crowd. He glanced down and frowned when he saw that Jason's mistress favored shiny, silver-toned sneakers with glittering, metallic laces. The rest of her attire was not nearly as tasteless, but it wasn't particularly inspiring, either. It consisted of a yellow oxford cloth button-down shirt and a pair of faded jeans.</p><p>"I wondered where you were, Sammy." Cleo smiled at the boy, and then her eyes met Max's.</p><p>He saw the startled expression that appeared in her soft hazel gaze. For a few seconds her gold-framed glasses afforded her no protection at all. In that brief moment she was as open to him as a work of art, and he knew that she was as aware of him as he was of her.</p><p>The impact of the flash of raw intimacy stunned Max. It was a dangerously disturbing experience, completely un...</p></p><h2>My Sister&#39;s Keeper: A Novel</h2><p><b>From the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Small Great Things </i>and <i>The Storyteller</i>, a &#x201c;beautifully crafted novel&#x201d; (<i>People</i>) that explores a family torn apart by conflicting needs and a passionate love that triumphs over human weakness.</b><br><br>Anna is not sick, but she might as well be.<br> <br>By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood.

The mechanics I understood&#x2014;my older brother Jesse had filled me in&#x2014;although at the time I was sure he&#x2019;d heard half of it wrong. Other kids my age were busy looking up the words penis and vagina in the classroom dictionary when the teacher had her back turned, but I paid attention to different details. Like why some mothers only had one child, while other families seemed to multiply before your eyes. Or how the new girl in school, Sedona, told anyone who&#x2019;d listen that she was named for the place where her parents were vacationing when they made her (&#x201c;Good thing they weren&#x2019;t staying in Jersey City,&#x201d; my father used to say).<br> <br>Now that I am thirteen, these distinctions are only more complicated: the eighth-grader who dropped out of school because she got into trouble; a neighbor who got herself pregnant in the hopes it would keep her husband from filing for divorce. I&#x2019;m telling you, if aliens landed on earth today and took a good hard look at why babies get born, they&#x2019;d conclude that most people have children by accident, or because they drink too much on a certain night, or because birth control isn&#x2019;t one hundred percent, or for a thousand other reasons that really aren&#x2019;t very flattering.<br> <br>On the other hand, I was born for a very specific purpose. I wasn&#x2019;t the result of a cheap bottle of wine or a full moon or the heat of the moment. I was born because a scientist managed to hook up my mother&#x2019;s eggs and my father&#x2019;s sperm to create a specific combination of precious genetic material. In fact, when Jesse told me how babies get made and I, the great disbeliever, decided to ask my parents the truth, I got more than I bargained for. They sat me down and told me all the usual stuff, of course&#x2014;but they also explained that they chose little embryonic me, specifically, because I could save my sister, Kate. &#x201c;We loved you even more,&#x201d; my mother made sure to say, &#x201c;because we knew what exactly we were getting.&#x201d;<br> <br>It made me wonder, though, what would have happened if Kate had been healthy. Chances are, I&#x2019;d still be floating up in Heaven or wherever, waiting to be attached to a body to spend some time on Earth. Certainly I would not be part of this family. See, unlike the rest of the free world, I didn&#x2019;t get here by accident. And if your parents have you for a reason, then that reason better exist. Because once it&#x2019;s gone, so are you.<br> <br>� � � <br> <br>Pawnshops may be full of junk, but they&#x2019;re also a breeding ground for stories, if you ask me, not that you did. What happened to make a person trade in the Never Before Worn Diamond Solitaire? Who needed money so badly they&#x2019;d sell a teddy bear missing an eye? As I walk up to the counter, I wonder if someone will look at the locket I&#x2019;m about to give up, and ask these same questions.<br> <br>The man at the cash register has a nose the shape of a turnip, and eyes sunk so deep I can&#x2019;t imagine how he sees well enough to go about his business. &#x201c;Need something?&#x201d; he asks.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s all I can do to not turn around and walk out the door, pretend I&#x2019;ve come in by mistake. The only thing that keeps me steady is knowing I am not the first person to stand in front of this counter holding the one item in the world I never thought I&#x2019;d part with.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have something to sell,&#x201d; I tell him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Am I supposed to guess what it is?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; Swallowing, I pull the locket out of the pocket of my jeans. The heart falls on the glass counter in a pool of its own chain. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fourteen-karat gold,&#x201d; I pitch. &#x201c;Hardly ever worn.&#x201d; This is a lie; until this morning, I haven&#x2019;t taken it off in seven years. My father gave it to me when I was six after the bone marrow harvest, because he said anyone who was giving her sister such a major present deserved one of her own. Seeing it there, on the counter, my neck feels shivery and naked.<br> <br>The owner puts a loupe up to his eye, which makes it seem almost normal size. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you twenty.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dollars?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, pesos. What did you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s worth five times that!&#x201d; I&#x2019;m guessing.<br> <br>The owner shrugs. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not the one who needs the money.&#x201d;<br> <br>I pick up the locket, resigned to sealing the deal, and the strangest thing happens&#x2014;my hand, it just clamps shut like the Jaws of Life. My face goes red with the effort to peel apart my fingers. It takes what seems like an hour for that locket to spill into the owner&#x2019;s outstretched palm. His eyes stay on my face, softer now. &#x201c;Tell them you lost it,&#x201d; he offers, advice tossed in for free.<br> <br>� � � <br> <br>If Mr. Webster had decided to put the word freak in his dictionary, Anna Fitzgerald would be the best definition he could give. It&#x2019;s more than just the way I look: refugee-skinny with absolutely no chest to speak of, hair the color of dirt, connect-the-dot freckles on my cheeks that, let me tell you, do not fade with lemon juice or sunscreen or even, sadly, sandpaper. No, God was obviously in some kind of mood on my birthday, because he added to this fabulous physical combination the bigger picture&#x2014;the household into which I was born.<br> <br>My parents tried to make things normal, but that&#x2019;s a relative term. The truth is, I was never really a kid. To be honest, neither were Kate and Jesse. I guess maybe my brother had his moment in the sun for the four years he was alive before Kate got diagnosed, but ever since then, we&#x2019;ve been too busy looking over our shoulders to run headlong into growing up. You know how most little kids think they&#x2019;re like cartoon characters&#x2014;if an anvil drops on their heads they can peel themselves off the sidewalk and keep going? Well, I never once believed that. How could I, when we practically set a place for Death at the dinner table?<br> <br>Kate has acute promyelocytic leukemia. Actually, that&#x2019;s not quite true&#x2014;right now she doesn&#x2019;t have it, but it&#x2019;s hibernating under her skin like a bear, until it decides to roar again. She was diagnosed when she was two; she&#x2019;s sixteen now. Molecular relapse and granulocyte and portacath&#x2014;these words are part of my vocabulary, even though I&#x2019;ll never find them on any SAT. I&#x2019;m an allogeneic donor&#x2014;a perfect sibling match. When Kate needs leukocytes or stem cells or bone marrow to fool her body into thinking it&#x2019;s healthy, I&#x2019;m the one who provides them. Nearly every time Kate&#x2019;s hospitalized, I wind up there, too.<br> <br>None of which means anything, except that you shouldn&#x2019;t believe what you hear about me, least of all that which I tell you myself.<br> <br>As I am coming up the stairs, my mother comes out of her room wearing another ball gown. &#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; she says, turning her back to me. &#x201c;Just the girl I wanted to see.&#x201d;<br> <br>I zip it up and watch her twirl. My mother could be beautiful, if she were parachuted into someone else&#x2019;s life. She has long dark hair and the fine collarbones of a princess, but the corners of her mouth turn down, like she&#x2019;s swallowed bitter news. She doesn&#x2019;t have much free time, since a calendar is something that can change drastically if my sister develops a bruise or a nosebleed, but what she does have she spends at Bluefly.com, ordering ridiculously fancy evening dresses for places she is never going to go. &#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; she asks.<br> <br>The gown is all the colors of a sunset, and made out of material that swishes when she moves. It&#x2019;s strapless, what a star might wear sashaying down a red carpet&#x2014;totally not the dress code for a suburban house in Upper Darby, RI. My mother twists her hair into a knot and holds it in place. On her bed are three other dresses&#x2014;one slinky and black, one bugle-beaded, one that seems impossibly small. &#x201c;You look . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Tired. The word bubbles right under my lips.<br> <br>My mother goes perfectly still, and I wonder if I&#x2019;ve said it without meaning to. She holds up a hand, shushing me, her ear cocked to the open doorway. &#x201c;Did you hear that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hear what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Kate.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t hear anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>But she doesn&#x2019;t take my word for it, because when it comes to Kate she doesn&#x2019;t take anybody&#x2019;s word for it. She marches upstairs and opens up our bedroom door to find my sister hysterical on her bed, and just like that the world collapses again. My father, a closet astronomer, has tried to explain black holes to me, how they are so heavy they absorb everything, even light, right into their center. Moments like this are the same kind of vacuum; no matter what you cling to, you wind up being sucked in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kate!&#x201d; My mother sinks down to the floor, that stupid skirt a cloud around her. &#x201c;Kate, honey, what hurts?&#x201d;<br> <br>Kate hugs a pillow to her stomach, and tears keep streaming down her face. Her pale hair is stuck to her face in damp streaks; her breathing&#x2019;s too tight. I stand frozen in the doorway of my own room, waiting for instructions: Call Daddy. Call 911. Call Dr. Chance. My mother goes so far as to shake a better explanation out of Kate. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Preston,&#x201d; she sobs. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s leaving Serena for good.&#x201d;<br> <br>That&#x2019;s when we notice the TV. On the screen, a blond hottie gives a longing look to a woman crying almost as hard as my sister, and then he slams the door. &#x201c;But what hurts?&#x201d; my mother asks, certain there has to be more to it than this.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh my God,&#x201d; Kate says, sniffling. &#x201c;Do you have any idea how much Serena and Preston have been through? Do you?&#x201d;<br> <br>That fist inside me relaxes, now that I know it&#x2019;s all right. Normal, in our house, is like a blanket too short for a bed&#x2014;sometimes it covers you just fine, and other times it leaves you cold and shaking; and worst of all, you never know which of the two it&#x2019;s going to be. I sit down on the end of Kate&#x2019;s bed. Although I&#x2019;m only thirteen, I&#x2019;m taller than her and every now and then people mistakenly assume I&#x2019;m the older sister. At different times this summer she has been crazy for Callahan, Wyatt, and Liam, the male leads on this soap. Now, I guess, it&#x2019;s all about Preston. &#x201c;There was the kidnapping scare,&#x201d; I volunteer. I actually followed that story line; Kate made me tape the show during her dialysis sessions.<br> <br>&#x201c;And the time she almost married his twin by mistake,&#x201d; Kate adds.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget when he died in the boat accident. For two months, anyway.&#x201d; My mother joins the conversation, and I remember that she used to watch this soap, too, sitting with Kate in the hospital.<br> <br>For the first time, Kate seems to notice my mother&#x2019;s outfit. &#x201c;What are you wearing?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh. Something I&#x2019;m sending back.&#x201d; She stands up in front of me so that I can undo her zipper. This mail-order compulsion, for any other mother, would be a wake-up call for therapy; for my mom, it would probably be considered a healthy break. I wonder if it&#x2019;s putting on someone else&#x2019;s skin for a while that she likes so much, or if it&#x2019;s the option of being able to send back a circumstance that just doesn&#x2019;t suit you. She looks at Kate, hard. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure nothing hurts?&#x201d;<br> <br>After my mother leaves, Kate sinks a little. That&#x2019;s the only way to describe it&#x2014;how fast color drains from her face, how she disappears against the pillows. As she gets sicker, she fades a little more, until I am afraid one day I will wake up and not be able to see her at all. &#x201c;Move,&#x201d; Kate orders. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re blocking the picture.&#x201d;<br> <br>So I go to sit on my own bed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only the coming attractions.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, if I die tonight I want to know what I&#x2019;m missing.&#x201d;<br> <br>I fluff my pillows up under my head. Kate, as usual, has swapped so that she has all the funchy ones that don&#x2019;t feel like rocks under your neck. She&#x2019;s supposed to deserve this, because she&#x2019;s three years older than me or because she&#x2019;s sick or because the moon is in Aquarius&#x2014;there&#x2019;s always a reason. I squint at the television, wishing I could flip through the stations, knowing I don&#x2019;t have a prayer. &#x201c;Preston looks like he&#x2019;s made out of plastic.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then why did I hear you whispering his name last night into your pillow?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shut up,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>&#x201c;You shut up.&#x201d; Then Kate smiles at me. &#x201c;He probably is gay, though. Quite a waste, considering the Fitzgerald sisters are&#x2014;&#x201d; Wincing, she breaks off mid-sentence, and I roll toward her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kate?&#x201d;<br> <br>She rubs her lower back. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing.&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s her kidneys. &#x201c;Want me to get Mom?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not yet.&#x201d; She reaches between our beds, which are just far apart enough for us to touch each other if we both try. I hold out my hand, too. When we were little we&#x2019;d make this bridge and try to see how many Barbies we could get to balance on it.<br> <br>Lately, I have been having nightmares, where I&#x2019;m cut into so many pieces that there isn&#x2019;t enough of me to be put back together.<br> <br>� � � <br> <br>My father says that a fire will burn itself out, unless you open a window and give it fuel. I suppose that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m doing, when you get right down to it; but then again, my dad also says that when flames are licking at your heels you&#x2019;ve got to break a wall or two if you want to escape. So when Kate falls asleep from her meds I take the leather binder I keep between my mattress and box spring and go into the bathroom for privacy. I know Kate&#x2019;s been snooping&#x2014;I rigged up a red thread between the zipper&#x2019;s teeth to let me know who was prying into my stuff without my permission, but even though the thread&#x2019;s been torn there&#x2019;s nothing missing inside. I turn on the water in the bathtub so it sounds like I&#x2019;m in there for a reason, and sit down on the floor to count.<br> <br>If you add in the twenty dollars from the pawnshop, I have $136.87. It&#x2019;s not going to be enough, but there&#x2019;s got to be a way around that. Jesse didn&#x2019;t have $2,900 when he bought his beat-up Jeep, and the bank gave him some kind of loan. Of course, my parents had to sign the papers, too, and I doubt they&#x2019;re going to be willing to do that for me, given the circumstances. I count the money a second time, just in case the bills have miraculously reproduced, but math is math and the total stays the same. And then I read the newspaper clippings.<br> <br>Campbell Alexander. It&#x2019;s a stupid name, in my opinion. It sounds like a bar drink that costs too much, or a brokerage firm. But you can&#x2019;t deny the man&#x2019;s track record.<br> <br>To reach my brother&#x2019;s room, you actually have to leave the house, which is exactly the way he likes it. When Jesse turned sixteen he moved into the attic over the garage&#x2014;a perfect arrangement, since he didn&#x2019;t want my parents to see what he was doing and my parents didn&#x2019;t really want to see. Blocking the stairs to his place are four snow tires, a small wall of cartons, and an oak desk tipped onto its side. Sometimes I think Jesse sets up these obstacles himself, just to make getting to him more of a challenge.<br> <br>I crawl over the mess and up the stairs, which vibrate with the bass from Jesse&#x2019;s stereo. It takes nearly five whole minutes before he hears me knocking. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; he snaps, opening the door a crack.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can I come in?&#x201d;<br> <br>He thinks twice, then steps back to let me enter. The room is a sea of dirty clothes and magazines and leftover Chinese take-out cartons; it smells like the sweaty tongue of a hockey skate. The only neat spot is the shelf where Jesse keeps his special collection&#x2014;a Jaguar&#x2019;s silver mascot, a Mercedes symbol, a Mustang&#x2019;s horse&#x2014;hood ornaments that he told me he just found lying around, although I&#x2019;m not dumb enough to believe him.<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t get me wrong&#x2014;it isn&#x2019;t that my parents don&#x2019;t care about Jesse or whatever trouble he&#x2019;s gotten himself mixed up in. It&#x2019;s just that they don&#x2019;t really have time to care about it, because it&#x2019;s a problem somewhere l...</p><h2>Tools Matter for Practicing the Spiritual Life</h2><p>In her previous book, Thoughts Matter: The Practice of the Spiritual Life, Sister Mary Margaret Funk, elaborating on the teaching of John Cassian, dealt with the eight classic &#34;thoughts&#34; that distract us from the presence of God. In her new book, casting her net more widely, she treats more than two dozen &#34;tools&#34; or practices of the spiritual life. Many of these (such as fasting, vigils, ceaseless prayer, and manual labor) derive from the desert mothers and fathers of the fourth and fifth centuries, but just as many come from later times: the practices of emptiness based on The Cloud of Unknowing, of recollection (Teresa of Avila), of self-abandonment (J. P. de Caussade), of the presence of God (Brother Lawrence), of colloquy (Gabrielle Bossis), and of the Little Way of Therese of Lisieux. The book concludes with a chapter on discernment, spiritual direction, and the limitations of each tool. Tools, says Funk, are means, not ends. &#34;Eventually, we discover, with freedom and love, that tools don&#39;t matter after all! God, our heart&#39;s desire, is all that matters!&#34; The book includes a comprehensive bibliography.</p><p>Mary Margaret Funk is a Benedictine nun of Our Lady of Grace Monastery, Beech Grove, Indiana, USA.

Nicolay&#39;s Interviews and Essays</h2><p><p>John C. Nicolay, who had known Lincoln in Springfield, Illinois, served as chief White House secretary from 1861 to 1865. Trained as a journalist, Nicolay had hoped to write a campaign biography of Lincoln in 1860, a desire that was thwarted when an obscure young writer named William Dean Howells got the job. Years later, however, Nicolay fulfilled his ambition; with John Hay, he spent the years from 1872 to 1890 writing a monumental ten-volume biography of Lincoln.</p><p>In preparation for this task, Nicolay interviewed men who had known Lincoln both during his years in Springfield and later when he became the president of the United States. "When it came time to write their massive biography, however," Burlingame notes, "he and Hay made sparing use of the interviews" because they had become "skeptical about human memory." Nicolay and Hay also feared that Robert Todd Lincoln might censor material that reflected "poorly on Lincoln or his wife."</p><p>Nicolay had interviewed such Springfield friends as Lincoln&#x2019;s first two law partners, John Todd Stuart and Stephen T. Logan. At the Illinois capital in June and July 1875, he talked to a number of others including Orville H. Browning, U.S. senator and Lincoln&#x2019;s close friend and adviser for over thirty-five years, and Ozias M. Hatch, Lincoln&#x2019;s political ally and Springfield neighbor. Four years later he returned briefly and spoke with John W. Bunn, a young political "insider" from Springfield at the time Lincoln was elected president, and once again with Hatch.</p><p>Browning shed new light on Lincoln&#x2019;s courtship and marriage, telling Nicolay that Lincoln often told him "that he was constantly under great apprehension lest his wife should do something which would bring him into disgrace" while in the White House. During their research, Nicolay and Hay also learned of Lincoln&#x2019;s despondency and erratic behavior following his rejection by Matilda Edwards, and they were subsequently criticized by friends for suppressing the information. Burlingame argues that this open discussion of Lincoln&#x2019;s depression of January 1841 is "perhaps the most startling new information in the Springfield interviews."</p><p>Briefer and more narrowly focused than the Springfield interviews, the Washington interviews deal with the formation of Lincoln&#x2019;s cabinet, his relations with Congress, his behavior during the war, his humor, and his grief. In a reminiscence by Robert Todd Lincoln, for example, we learn of Lincoln&#x2019;s despair at General Lee's escape after the Battle of Gettysburg: "I went into my father&#x2019;s office ... and found him in [much]&nbsp;distress, his head leaning upon the desk in front of him, and when he raised his head there were evidences of tears upon his face. Upon my asking the cause of his distress he told me that he had just received the information that Gen. Lee had succeeded in escaping across the Potomac river. . ."</p><p>To supplement these interviews, Burlingame has included Nicolay&#x2019;s unpublished essays on Lincoln during the 1860 campaign and on Lincoln&#x2019;s journey from Springfield to Washington in 1861, essay&#x2019;s based on firsthand testimony.</p><b></b></p><p><p><b>Michael Burlingame</b>, Sadowski Professor of History Emeritus at Connecticut College, is the author of <i>The Inner World of Abraham Lincoln</i> and the editor of ten volumes of primary sources about Lincoln, including <i>With Lincoln in the White House: Letters, Memoranda, and Other Writings of John G.

On the cargo ship he was their only passenger. In the last days of the ship&#x2019;s journey it had grown warm and when he remarked that there was no snow, the crew members laughed. They had been throwing fish overboard, as they always did, for luck, and he watched as the birds twisted their bodies in the wind and dove. He had never seen the ocean before, had never journeyed so far as he had in this month alone. He was called Yohan and he was twenty-five years old.<br> <br>He was dressed in an old gray suit that was too large for him and wore a hat with a short brim. They were not his clothes. They had been given to him at the camp and after he had changed, the young nurse, an American, took the military shirt he had worn for all those years and folded it with care even though it was torn and stale, no longer recognizable.<br> <br>The nurse had thin shoulders, he remembered, and her neck had darkened from the sun. She had been kind to him. Through all the days at the camp there had been that. But he did not tell her so and he said his farewells to the guards and the doctors who stood in a line under the tent in that long field where the sky was always low and vast and where there was always a wind that carried the smell of the soil and sickness and the sound of animals from a nearby farm.<br> <br>He was escorted into the back of a UN truck. It had snowed the night before but the day was clear as he left. From a tower someone waved. He shut his eyes and thought of castles.<br> <br>He had also been given a rucksack with a spare shirt and trousers. A letter confirming his residence and his employment was in his jacket pocket, tucked behind a folded handkerchief.<br> <br>It was close to dawn, and the ship was near land, when the rain began to fall. The rain was slow and light and they all remained on deck. Yohan felt the drops tap the brim of his hat and vanish along his shoulders. His eyes were dry and red from the wind. The night before, facing a mirror in a cabin, he had clipped his hair short, the way the nurses had often cut his hair in the camp, checking for lice. He had also shaved, unsure at first whether he remembered how, hesitating before pressing the razor against his skin.<br> <br>He could see now the coast. It resembled a cloud at first. Then it changed and the line broke into segments and he saw the tiles of rooftops and the stone and the whitewashed walls following the slope of a tall hill.<br> <br>The port grew visible. Then the sails and the masts of ships. He gripped the railing and followed the smoke from the steamers rising above the town.<br> <br>Near the peak he could make out a church spire and higher, on the open ridge, a single large tree. Farther up the coast, to the north, a plantation house stood in a long field. And farther still, on a headland, a lighthouse was flashing.<br> <br>They entered the harbor. As the ship approached a pier they were surrounded by a low fog and the sudden echo of voices and engines and the strains of ropes against pulleys. Merchants were looking up at them, motioning their arms and lifting the goods that they were selling. Fishermen were cleaning their boats; landowners were preparing to journey farther west, to visit their farms and their tenants.<br> <br>He said the name of this country and then said it again.<br> <br>The ship docked and he helped the men unload their shipment. He kept his eyes focused on the ship, on the crates sliding down the gangplank. He felt movement behind him, heard a slow hammering. He caught the scent of blood but was unsure whether it was his imagination or from all the fishing nets moving through the air.<br> <br>The rain had not stopped and one of the sailors, the oldest of them, offered him an umbrella. It was blue with a wooden handle.<br> <br>The sailor shrugged and grinned and said, &#x2014;From the child, and pointed up at the ship where Yohan thought he saw a crown of hair and the length of a pale scarf gliding along the sky. A young boy was running after her, waving, and from that distance Yohan caught the voice of the girl, its delicacy and assuredness, the way it rose like a kite, the foreign cadence of words in another language.<br> <br>He paused, as though expecting something. But then they were gone and he was unsure whether he had seen or heard them at all, unsure whether he had understood the sailor correctly. There were no other passengers, he was told.<br> <br>&#x2014;To a good life, the sailor said now, and Yohan shook hands with them all, catching the fatigue in their oil-stained faces, these men whom he had lived with for over a month and who had made an effort to keep him company on that ship, teaching him card games, sharing their cigarettes, telling him what little they knew of the country where they had just arrived.<br> <br>The sailors were South Korean. In the war they had been in the navy and there had been times during the trip when they gathered on the deck in the evenings as the weather grew warm and they passed around a bottle and told him of the fighting at sea. But then they looked at one another and then at Yohan and grew silent.<br> <br>They spoke instead of their lives now and the families they started, how they had been shipping cargo for a year and how they had moved to Japan, where there was more work to be found.<br> <br>&#x2014;And wives, one of the sailors had said, approaching the edge of the deck.<br> <br>In his hand he held the bottle they had been drinking from, a long wick slipped into it, then the spark of a match. His hand aglow as he threw the bottle into the night, the momentary flare in the sky, then that brief explosion and Yohan hiding his body&#x2019;s reaction to the noise and the sailors shouting up at that vast dark they traveled through.<br> <br>Now, on the pier, a month later, he did not want to part with them. He lingered close, listening to them speak in Korean, not knowing when he would hear it again. But there was nothing more to say and so he looked at them one last time and waved.<br> <br>He left the harbor and made his way inland, sheltered by his new umbrella, following a narrow road into a neighborhood of apartments and shops. Alone now, he stared at all the street markers and the hanging signs, his body suddenly overwhelmed by the noises of a town, its new smells, an unknown language.<br> <br>The sailors had taught him as much Portuguese as they could, what little they themselves had learned, but he could no longer remember the words and the phrases, his mind searching for some remnant but unable to find one, unable to focus and settle as he followed the road.<br> <br>The town was large, almost a city, and opened out along the rise of the hill. As he moved farther into the town he felt its density, its height. He kept looking up at the unfamiliar architecture, the designs of gates and entrances, the high floors. Buildings were the color of seashells. The dark windows everywhere like a thousand doors in the land.<br> <br>A girl on a bicycle approached and he stepped onto the sidewalk as she sped past him, throwing newspapers against closed entrances. He paused, caught by a memory. He had not seen a bicycle in years. The rain lifted off the wheels as the girl pedaled farther away. A light appeared inside a bakery, then the smoke from a thin flue on the roof.<br> <br>He stopped a fisherman, showing him a business card, and the man pointed toward the ridge and motioned his arm to the right. He followed a cobblestone road, turning at a barbershop and continuing along another road that moved around the slope, past row houses with narrow, brightly painted shutters. He began to notice paper signs on the windows, written in Japanese.<br> <br>The tailor&#x2019;s shop stood between an apartment and a pharmacy. The building was whitewashed and two stories tall. There was no sign. There were instead two large windows through which he could see tables, rolls of fabric, and a tailor&#x2019;s dummy with a measuring tape draped around the shoulders of its headless body.<br> <br>It was early in the morning. From across the street he looked up at the second-floor windows.<br> <br>And it was there, standing in front of the tailor&#x2019;s shop, as the rain fell, that he felt the tiredness of his journey for the first time. He heard the rush of a storm drain and his legs weakened and he grew dizzy. He gripped the umbrella and thought of the years that had passed and were an ocean away now. He thought of Korea and the war there and he thought of the camp near the southern coast of that country, beside an airbase, where he had been a prisoner for two years. He thought of the day he woke and saw the trees and then the men with their helmets and their weapons swaying around him like chimes.<br> <br>The Americans called them northerners and those first weeks they kept his wrists bound. But then the doctors, in need of men, untied him and the others, and he dug graves and washed clothes in buckets. He carried trays for the nurses and took walks in the yard with Peng or the missionaries who visited, following the high fences, the men in the towers looking down at them.<br> <br>He slept in a cabin with the other prisoners and in the winters the heat of their bodies kept them warm. Moonlight kept them company, the way it leaked through the timber walls and shifted across them as the hours passed; and sleepless, he thought of his father and all that snow in the winters in that mountain town where Yohan was born and where he had lived and it all seemed so far to him then, as though the earth had expanded, his memories, too, and he could no longer grasp them. And only then, when those thoughts began to recede, fading into a thin line, would he sleep.<br> <br>He did not know when exactly the war ended. He did not hear of it until some days later.<br> <br>One day he was told they would return him to his home. To his country, they said. To the north.<br> <br>&#x2014;Repatriation, they called it.<br> <br>He declined their offer. From the camp he was the only one.<br> <br>So he stayed a while longer, helping the doctors with the ones who were too sick to travel and would not last long. He held the young men&#x2019;s hands if they wanted him to or sat beside them and described the fields and the trees and the clouds, and the young men smiled and thought of their mothers, unable to open their eyes or move their heads. And some wept and said that they were sorry, so very sorry, and he wondered what they were sorry for, but it was all right because in their eyes he could see that they were not looking at him but someone else in the last of their dreams.<br> <br>And then some time later a man visited.<br> <br>&#x2014;From the United Nations, he said, and they gathered around a table under a tent with the nurses and the missionaries.<br> <br>There was an agreement with Brazil, the man said, and Yohan remained silent. He had never heard that word before. If he wanted to, the man said, for the camp would soon be gone.<br> <br>&#x2014;The sun, the nurse beside him said, looking far away where the snow from the trees had begun to scatter. I bet there&#x2019;s so much sun.<br> <br>And he thought of a place where there would be no more nights.<br> <br>&#x2014;Brazil, Yohan said, and the man nodded and the nurse smiled and so he did, too.<br> <br>There was a tailor there. A Japanese man. Kiyoshi was his name. Yohan would be the tailor&#x2019;s apprentice because he had mended clothes at the camp. He was good at it, the nurse said, and Yohan looked down at his hands, forgetting that when the UN man appeared he had been stooped over the table, under the tent, mending the clothes that had been taken, during that war, from the dead.<br> <br>It was now 1954. He stood on the sidewalk, holding the blue umbrella.<br> <br>The rain continued to fall. It fell on the rooftops on the slopes of the hill and in the narrow streets and the alleyways and on the windows of the tailor&#x2019;s shop, blurring the image of his body. The morning was gray and the color of rust. All the sounds of the waking city seemed to rise toward the sky, dissipating as the rain fell.<br> <br>A puddle began to form on the sidewalk where he stood; the toes of his shoes had grown wet and dark.<br> <br>He regained his strength. He adjusted his hat and then his rucksack. From his jacket pocket he took out the letter. He crossed the street and knocked once on the glass door. Waiting there, opposite his reflection, his hands shook and he stilled them.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>From where he stood outside he could now see the shop in its entirety: a single long room with a dark wood floor, worn pale by footsteps and the legs of chairs and tables; fabrics piled on shelves and leaning against walls stained by cigarette smoke; sewing machines on worktables; wooden boxes filled with scissors and sewing needles and spools of thread. A portable radio. An old fan with a single lightbulb hanging from the low ceiling.<br> <br>He leaned closer to the glass. In the back there was a heavy red curtain covering a doorway, framed by a dim light.<br> <br>It was from there that a man appeared, pushing the curtain to the side. He was short and walked with a stoop. He was wearing an undershirt and a vest and his hair was gray and long, tied in the back with a piece of thread. As the man approached, his slippers hit the floor in a slow rhythm, like the soft pattern of rain against the dome of the umbrella Yohan held.<br> <br>The man lifted his hand.<br> <br>&#x2014;It&#x2019;s open, he called, in Japanese, but continued to approach and, with effort, opened the door himself.<br> <br>Yohan had not spoken Japanese in some time and he struggled to respond, reaching for a language that seemed to float in a far memory.<br> <br>&#x2014;Come in, come in, the man said, and Yohan entered, leaving the umbrella outside by one of the shop windows.<br> <br>There was no longer the sound of rain, or it had faded, and his ears adjusted now to the low hum of the radio and the ceiling fan. He could smell a broth of some kind, and tea, and he remembered then that he had not eaten since the day before, a small meal with the crew, mindful of their sharing. He was suddenly struck with hunger.<br> <br>But he remained still. They stood facing each other at the front of the shop, silent until the man&#x2019;s eyes focused on Yohan&#x2019;s suit. The man reached for him and pinched the fabric on each shoulder.<br> <br>&#x2014;I see the problem, the tailor said.<br> <br>Yohan took out the letter and bowed. The man slipped on a pair of reading glasses that he kept in his vest pocket.<br> <br>While he read, Yohan studied the man&#x2019;s face: his calm eyes, his thick lips, the old and dark skin that had spent years under the sun.<br> <br>This was Kiyoshi, in his expression a patience and also a steadiness Yohan would grow accustomed to over the years.<br> <br>The tailor folded the letter and slipped it into his vest pocket along with his reading glasses. He lit a cigarette. He took Yohan&#x2019;s hand. Kiyoshi&#x2019;s fingers were warm and rough.<br> <br>&#x2014;Welcome, he said, continuing to speak in Japanese.<br> <br>He reached for the rucksack, attempted to lift it, but changed his mind and tapped Yohan on the shoulder, motioning for him to follow.<br> <br>They headed to the back of the room, passing through the curtain, into a kitchen. A teakettle and a pot of soup were on the stove. Beyond the kitchen there was a door ajar, revealing the corner of a small room: a nightstand, the spine of a book, slippers, and an ashtray, the edge of a cot that reminded him of the field hospital in the camp, the gray light of the morning extending onto the floor.<br> <br>But they did not go there. They turned and climbed a set of narrow stairs that creaked with each step. They went slowly, Kiyoshi leading and holding on to the handrail, his cigarette smoke lifting toward the dim lights in ...</p><h2>Israel: Land and the People</h2><p>In 1998 Israel celebrated fifty years as a nation, yet its future is as uncertain as its past has been unsettled.

In this rollicking memoir, Jane and Michael Stern tell what it's like to eat everywhere across the U.S.A. Driving more than three million miles, eating twelve meals a day, they discover not only the pleasure of biscuits and gravy and cherry pie r la mode, but a world of cooks, customers, and fellow roadfood devotees for whom good food is one of life's essentials.<br><br>Hop into the car for hilarious adventures and misadventures as the Sterns search for the definitive barbecue, sandwiches, Indian fry bread, sweet potato pie, and other treasures along America's highways and byways. Eat in a midnight restaurant where a "murderburger" is the specialty, dine in a place whose proprietor is devoted to the memory of Richard Nixon, devour ribs alongside a cook's pet pig, and feast at one of the last of the old-time boarding houses. You'll meet such personalities as America's greatest bull rider (who won't eat clams but downs deep-fried lamb testicles), a waitress who gets her dining tips straight from Jesus, and a pre-reality-show radio homemaker who broadcasts straight from her kitchen.<br><br>Join the Sterns at the start of their journey when, fresh out of grad school and with little more than hunger as their guide, they hit the road in search of something to eat. Discover with them a strategy to maximize cafeteria tray capacity (desserts first) and to sniff out a great breakfast in an unfamiliar town. Best of all, savor the delicious potluck banquet of beloved regional fare, unusual eateries, and the unforgettable characters who make up American food.</p><p><p>JANE and MICHAEL STERN are the authors of the best-selling <i>Roadfood </i>and the acclaimed memoir <i>Two for the Road. </i>They are contributing editors to <em>Gourmet</em>, where they write the James Beard Award&#x2013;winning column "Roadfood," and they appear weekly on NPR&#x2019;s <i>The Splendid Table. </i>Winners of a James Beard Lifetime Achievement Award, the Sterns have also been inducted into the Who&#x2019;s Who of Food and Beverage in America.</p>1 Two for the Road <br><br>Our first date was over a white clam pizza at Pepe&#x2019;s Pizzeria on Wooster Square in New Haven, Connecticut, and it was instantly apparent as we gazed into each other&#x2019;s eyes across the thin-crusted Neapolitan pie, speckled with tiny, tender clams and frosted with olive oil, that we shared a passion for garlic. Our initial lust for each other was fueled by an orgy of lobster rolls, split hot dogs, Yankee Doodle Double Dandy Doodle Burger cheeseburgers, calzones, and cannolis.<br> Michael had won a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship at Yale, where we had both gone to study art, so we had plenty of money to spend exploring restaurants up and down the Yankee shore. Compared to the average grad student, he was a high roller with a monthly stipend to squander. He also possessed what was, to Jane&#x2019;s New York City sensibility, an amazing status symbol: a car. At twenty-one, Jane had not yet learned how to drive. The car was our ticket to romance and to eating adventures.<br> The fellowship money was diverted from expensive textbooks and art museum field trips to fund a comparative study of the differences among pizzas as made by Pepe&#x2019;s, Sally&#x2019;s, and the Spot in the old Italian neighborhood, as well as the Greek-style pizzas at Pizza House, which was less than fifty yards from our apartment. If pizza was our major interest,we minored in fried dough at summertime fairs, clams and chowder and lobsters all along the coast, and Yorkshire pudding at Mory&#x2019;s, the Yalie dining club, where it was still possible to have a completely gelatinized meal, from aspic to Jell-O. Nearly every day, Michael had a choice to face: a seminar in medieval imagery in a dank basement lecture room in New Haven or a trip to the Rhode Island beaches with Jane for a shore dinner and a hot fudge sundae on ginger ice cream? Our passion for each other, and for finding things to eat, won out every time.<br> We were married in 1970, and a year later we got our degrees, which meant that the fellowship-subsidized grad school eating bonanza was coming to an end. It was the worst of times and the best of times. We moved to a little shack in the woods of Guilford, Connecticut, where we didn&#x2019;t even have a telephone. We were hiding out from life. Jane&#x2019;s mother and father died of cancer within a year of each other. Her stepfather disinherited her. Her two favorite cousins died, and her aunt was institutionalized. In despair, Jane made the fifteen mile drive into New Haven three times a week to stare at the index cards in the Yale Employment Center. Michael spent his time cultivating and smoking cannabis. After tens of thousands of dollars were spent on our highfalutin educations, we realized we had little interest in pursuing what we had studied.<br> And so we did what generations of writers have done before us. We hit the road. The difference is that when we did so, we had no idea that we were to become writers. We just wanted to get away from everything.<br> We proposed a book about truck-stop dining to a young editor, who thought it was a cute idea and gave us the princely advance of $2,500.We thought we had won the lottery. But after signing the contract to write the book, we froze. Who were we to write about food, even truck-stop food? Where did we come off, telling people what was good to eat? Our shared mental image of a restaurant critic was gleaned from old movies: a patrician fellow with a silk ascot, his pinkie in the air and a sneer on his face. Somebody like Vincent Price but soured with indigestion. Restaurant critics were gourmets, and gourmets ate such grotesque things as creamed snails, sick-looking liver p�t�s, cheeses that smelled like feet, and odd organs from inside unusual animals. In our mind&#x2019;s eye, gourmet food was joke food, like what you might be forced to ingest during a fraternity hazing. We preferred hamburgers, mashed potatoes, and apple cobbler.<br> The notion that we had promised our publisher to write a coast-to- coast guidebook was overwhelming. We had pretty much not gone anywhere at all. We had no knowledge of exactly where these marvelous truck stops were, scant experience writing, and no money beyond the first half of our advance.<br> We sat together at the kitchen table of our $99-per-month cabin trying to figure out what to do. The one-room shack where we lived might seem romantic if you saw it in the movies, but in real life it was hideously uncomfortable. After living there for nearly a year, we discovered a case of decomposing dynamite in the crawlspace above the ceiling, left behind by a 1960s radical who was a former tenant. The gas stove was so old and decrepit that it once combusted and singed Jane&#x2019;s eyebrows off as she checked on a roasting chicken. This home off ours was a good incentive for getting on the road.<br> We agreed on a plan: we would review every restaurant in America. This seemed nooooot the slightest bit of a stretch to us. Not having traveled much, we looked at the Rand McNally map spread out on the kitchen table and could plainly see that America was a manageable place, no more than a foot and a half in length, composed of pretty pastel-colored states balanced on one another like building blocks.<br> Strategy well in place, we launched into part two of the plan: buying a suitable car for the journey. Just as buying a new handbag has always been Jane&#x2019;s favorite antidote for whatever ails her, buying a car is Michael&#x2019;s solution to just about any problem. Even Sigmund Freud would blush at the patent sexual symbolism of both objects, but we were too young and dumb to notice or care.<br> At a nearby car dealership, we met a salesman whose necktie we remember to this day, more than a quarter century later. Somehow this guy had managed to knot it absolutely flat, so that its front apron cascaded directly from his collar with no lump whatsoever, sort of like a sheet of molten polyester. As we told the salesman our needs and he touted the glories of the new &#x2019;75 Chevy line, we paid far more attention to his neckwear than to vehicular statistics. When we finally stopped marveling at it and told him our budget, he became significantly less chummy, got up from his desk, and led us around to the back lot, where the less alluring and less expensive used vehicles were kept, out of sight of new-car shoppers. He pointed to a pre- owned Chevrolet Suburban. It was vomit green the barf of someone who lived on frozen peas. Several body panels had been painted in a shop that didn&#x2019;t worry too much about matching the factory-original metallic color, so it had become a kind of rolling ode to all possible avocado hues, including even black (the hood). It was huge and it was ugly, something like a cross between a World War II tank and an over-the- hill Brady Bunch station wagon.<br> Jane grimaced at the sight of it. Michael tried to convince her that it had a rugged look, befitting the intrepid travelers we wanted to be. He lifted the hood and looked at the engine, pretending to know what he was inspecting. And just to show the salesman that we were no patsies when it came to purchasing a roadworthy vehicle, we both walked around and kicked all four tires. They didn&#x2019;t pop on impact, but neither did any of them appear to have a lot of tread.<br> One thing the car had in its favor was vast amounts of room inside. To save money in our travels, we planned to camp out in it, forgoing motel rooms. I&#x2019;ll sew curtains and we can hang them on the back windows for privacy,&#x201d; Jane said optimistically, never having sewn anything in her life.<br> And it does have two air conditioners,&#x201d; Michael noted. We won&#x2019;t be hot!&#x201d; By the time we wrote the check, we were convinced that this heap would be a rather deluxe residence on wheels for the next two years.<br> The following morning, on the way to the grocery store, the left rear tire blew. And that summer gas prices doubled. We faced the first big gas crisis in a vehicle that got approximately eight miles to the gallon.<br> Jane had plenty of time to sew curtains for the back windows, because five months into the research for Roadfood, we had not yet left Connecticut. In fact, we hadn&#x2019;t even left New Haven County.<br> Yale had trained us to be meticulous in our research, and, ever the diligent academics, we commenced work on the guidebook by picking up the local Yellow Pages and opening to Restaurant.&#x201d; We began with those starting with the letter A. We ate at the Acropolis Diner and made notes about the good souvlaki. We went to Addie&#x2019;s Caf�, where we didn&#x2019;t much care for the hash browns, then on to Angela&#x2019;s Pizzeria, where we thought the pepperoni pie was better then the sausage, and Archie Moore&#x2019;s tavern, where the beer inevitably distracted us from our mission of sampling the menu.<br> At the end of five months we had gotten to Donat&#x2019;s, an overreaching French restaurant where rich professors ate, and had yet to travel more than twelve miles from home. We envisioned the millennia that stretched out before we began reviewing restaurants in, say, Kansas.<br> Something was wrong with our plan.<br> People will not take us seriously if we haven&#x2019;t eaten everywhere,&#x201d; moaned Jane, who, like so many writers, lives in constant fear that someone will discover she doesn&#x2019;t know everything or anything at all.<br> Tough shit,&#x201d; Michael responded. Jane thought he had a point.<br> We sat down at the kitchen table again, scrutinized the map, and came up with a new plan.<br> With a Magic Marker we drew a squiggly continuous line through forty-eight states. It would take a full two years and countless tanks of gas to travel this route, but at least we would finally get on the road. We would see all the pretty pastel states and eat in every one of them.<br> The new plan in place, we went shopping for supplies. We loaded the cavernous green Suburban with inflatable mattresses, sleeping bags, mosquito netting, snakebite kits, and everything else two urban Jews who had never slept anywhere but in a bed figured they would need to camp out.<br> No!&#x201d; Michael railed as Jane insisted on buying tin plates, a small Coleman stove, and a stack of collapsible cutlery. We are going to be eating in a dozen restaurants every day,&#x201d; he said. The last thing we&#x2019;re going to want to do when we make camp is cook another meal.&#x201d; Jane added a portable oxygen tank to the stash of material, because she was convinced that she would not be able to breathe in mountainous states like Colorado.<br> We were good to go. We spent a whole day packing the Suburban with supplies to take us across the country and through all seasons. The lumpy calico curtains Jane had sewn for the back-seat area made the car even uglier, if that was possible. We turned the skeleton key in the lock of our cabin door and drove away.<br> We sped west out of Connecticut over the Hudson River and into New Jersey. First stop: early lunch in a diner. Ahh yes, a New Jersey diner! What could be a more excellent start to our adventure? Sadly, the food was mediocre; the mashed potatoes were made from a powdered mix. When we asked the waitress what kind of pie there was, she answered, Red.&#x201d; Sure enough, the slice we got was sweet translucent red mucilage without even a hint of fruit. We got off the Jersey Turnpike a few exits farther south and found a place called Nature&#x2019;s Cupboard. It was a vegetarian restaurant run by Woodstock alumni, and it smelled more like Nature&#x2019;s Locker Room. We didn&#x2019;t bother to order, just turned around and headed south again. After three more unproductive stops at highway exit ramps, where we found rubbery chicken croquettes, a desiccated Philly cheese steak, and cardboard- crusted pizza, our enthusiasm was waning. By the time we got to Maryland, it was suppertime.<br> We decided to spend our first night on the road at a place called Jellystone Park, one of a national chain of campgrounds that feature a goofy image of Yogi Bear to welcome visitors. For a few bucks paid to a lady at the gatehouse, we were directed to a small plot of turf where we were told to park and set up.<br> The gatekeeper knew of no restaurants anywhere near the park, but she did direct us to a convenience store, where we bought readymade ham sandwiches on white bread, bags of potato chips, and cans of soda, which we ate sitting in the front seat of our car in the store parking lot. We drove to our spot at Jellystone Park to bed down for the night.<br> The place was filled with families in oversized motor homes with small cars attached to the back. Their immense recreational vehicles sprouted TV antennas and had golf carts and lawn chairs lashed to the roof. Many of them were plastered with decals proclaiming their owners&#x2019;membership in the Good Sam club, meaning they were certifiably nice people good Samaritans who would pull alongside a wounded or disabled fellow traveler to offer help. On the backs of some of the big rolling homes, the owners had their names painted in florid script, generally using the errant apostrophe so common on mailboxes everywhere: The Smith&#x2019;s: Bill and Edna.&#x201d; The RV community took one look at our overgrown station wagon and turned their backs on us. They may have been Good Sams to one another, but we were clearly not in their league. We didn&#x2019;t have a real motor home with a television and kitchen and wall-to-wall carpeting, and besides, the curtains Jane had stitched were flagrantly homemade. They hated us. We hated them.<br> Don&#x2019;t you just know those stupid Winnebagos are going to be clogging every superhighway from here to California,&#x201d; Michael groused, imagining us at the end of a long line of motor homes traveling at thirty miles an hour from coast to coast, staring for weeks at the ass end of The Smith&#x2019;s: Bill and Edna.&#x201d; It was at that moment that we vowed to travel only on back roads a spur-of-the-moment decision that determined the path for our eating career.<br> The RV camp-out was the longest night of our lives. We tossed and turned on the clammy rubber air mattresses. The Suburban, which had seemed so big when it was empty, came to feel as claustrophobic as a mummy&#x2019;s sarcophagus. Despite the mosquito netting, which had a habit of getting tangled around our legs, we were soon swatting at bugs the size of velociraptors, and when we had to pee in the middle of the night, we were too afraid to make the trek to the Jellystone restrooms, lest a bear eat us. Despite all our snakebite kits and collapsible silverware, we had forgotten to take along a flashlight.<br> We left at dawn in despair and sold all the camping junk at the first pawnshop we saw. Back in our newly roomy car, we drove away from that first unpleasant night on the road with our culinary dreams dashed. We meandered south along back roads, finding nothing notable to eat. At twilight we were so tired that we pulled into the first roadside motel that didn&#x2019;t look as if Norman Bates was the proprietor.<br> Entering our unit, as the motel-keeper referred to the room, we blinked in awe at the modernity of a television set and a tiled shower stall, feeling a little like Ishi, the Stone Age tribesman wandering out of the woods into civilization for the first time. We slept wonderfully, and when the sun rose in the morning, we were so happy not to be surrounded by huge, hostile motor homes, we even thought our Suburban looked rather sleek and handsome.<br> We pushed an eight-track Merle Haggard tape into the slot, and as Merle serenaded us with songs of workin&#x2019; men, we cruised in the direction of the nearest little town on the map, at least ten miles away from the interstate.<br> It was a pretty south Virginia hamlet of clapboard houses with broad front porches. The rising sun cast the long shadows of ancient oak trees across tidy front lawns. An old man wearing overalls sat on a wooden chair and waved at us as we drove by his porch. We passed children riding their bikes in what we assumed was the direction of the schoolyard. We were trave...</p><h2>FRANK SINATRA: MY FATHER</h2><p>The author offers a personal look at the popular American singer and actor, describes his complex personality, and shares the reminiscences of his friends and colleagues</p><p>Nancy Sinatra's biography may prove to be her father's best gift on his approaching 70th birthday. Combined with an album of hundreds of photos in color and black-and-white, this is a lavish tribute to Francis Albert Sinatra, by his oldest child. She writes colorfully about him, their family, friends and colleagues, who recall "The Voice" before and after he emerged from Hoboken and became a world-class entertainer. The author offers her opinions on accusations that her father has been involved with gangsters, on his changing political loyalties and other news-making stories that have made the star controversial. A musician herself, she makes knowlegeable observations about her father's apparently effortless singing techniques. She also details his bounce back after a stalled career in movies and concerts, several retirements, etc. She reminisces about the sad effects of the first Sinatra divorce on his children and their reactions to his successive marriages. She writes with pride about her father's considerable charitable contributions, known heretofore only to a few. Although the biography is decidedly personal and biased by a loving daughter, it is a welcome change from the memoirs by others who savage their famous parents. Literary Guild special selection.

Among his greatest accomplishments as a scholar was his 1492 Latin translation of the complete works of Plotinus (204&#x2013;270 CE), the founder of Neoplatonism. The 1492 edition also contained an immense commentary that remained for centuries the principle introduction to Plotinus&#x2019;s works for Western scholars. At the same time, it constitutes a major statement of Ficino&#x2019;s own late metaphysics. The I Tatti edition, planned in six volumes, contains the first modern edition of the Latin text and the first translation into any modern language. The present volume also contains an extensive analytical study of Ficino&#x2019;s interpretation of Plotinus&#x2019;s <i>Third Ennead</i>.</p><p><p>Stephen Gersh is Professor of Medieval Studies at the University of Notre Dame.</p></p><h2>Fairy Caravan</h2><p>The Fairy Caravan is the story of a miniature circus - William and Alexander&#39;s Traveling Circus.

The various divine attributes do not represent parts of God that, when combined, make up God's nature. However, what was once part of the theological tradition from Irenaeus to Jonathan Edwards can now be said to have nothing to do with Christian theology.<i>Divine Simplicity</i> engages the recent critics and addresses one of their major concerns: that the doctrine of divine simplicity is not a biblical teaching. By analyzing the use of Scripture by key theologians from the early church to Karl Barth, Barrett finds that divine simplicity developed in order to respond to theological errors (e.g., Eunomianism) and to avoid misreading Scripture. Through close attention to Scripture, the work also argues that divine simplicity has two biblical roots: the names of God and the indivisible operations of the Trinity <i>ad extra</i>. After clarifying its biblical origins, the volume then explains how divine simplicity can be rearticulated by following a formal analogy from the doctrine of the Trinity--the <i>analogia diversitatis</i> (analogy of diversity)--in which the divine attributes are identical to the divine essence but are not identical to each other.</p><p><b>Jordan P. Barrett</b> is adjunct professor at Moody Bible Institute and Bread of Life Theological Seminary. This volume is based on dissertation completed at Wheaton College under the supervision of Kevin J. Vanhoozer.Jordan Barrett offers a compelling account of the contemporary theological debate about divine simplicity set against the historical developments of the doctrine. He clarifies what is at stake, and demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of present-day defenders, revisers, and opponents of the doctrine. If he had done no more than this, we would be enormously in his debt, for bringing order out of much chaos. But he does more: offering a reading of Biblical themes that should inform a doctrine of simplicity, he presents a nuanced and original account of the doctrine that is resistant to many criticisms. Anyone interested in this fascinating area of theology will want to study this book carefully. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;~ Stephen R. Holmes, Head of the School of Divinity, University of St Andrews.<br><br>Is the doctrine of simplicity a biblical doctrine? In this illuminating study, Barrett shows that it is not only biblical, but also that we cannot understand or rightly praise the holy Trinity without affirming the Persons' divine simplicity. Barrett combines exhaustive erudition and balanced judgment with an unusually clear and accessible writing style, which makes this book especially attractive for undergraduate and graduate courses on the triune God.~ Matthew Levering, James N. and Mary D.

From perfume to spice, from religion to art, the trade and exchange of goods and ideas was crucial to the development of civilizations throughout the region, and the world. <br><br>This book is the first comprehensive illustrated publication on the Silk Roads. Edited by an established authority on the subject, The Silk Roads situates the ancient routes against the landscapes that defined them, to reveal the raw materials that they produced, the means of travel that were employed to traverse them and the communities that were formed by them. Organized by terrain, from steppe to desert to ocean, each section includes detailed maps, a historical overview, thematic essays and features showcasing iconic art objects, buildings and archaeological discoveries. A wealth of photographs reveal the breathtaking landscapes of Central Asia, mostly unseen by those who haven&#x2019;t travelled the routes. <br><br>Designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2014, the Silk Road has never been of greater interest or importance than today. This beautiful publication honours the astonishing diversity in the way cultures can advance and flourish not in spite of their differences, but because of them.</p><p></p><h2>Leaves from the Olive Tree: An Anthology of Kingdom Perspectives</h2><p>Leaves from the Olive tree is an anthology by Dr. Howard Morgan.

Each chapter reflects Dr. Morgan&#39;s passion to equip the church for the fulfillment of God&#39;s eternal purposes and ultimately see the Kingdom of God established with the return of Messiah Yeshua.</p><p>For more about Dr. Morgan and his ministry, please visit his website, &nbsp;HMMin.com&nbsp;<br>You may contact him at Drmkmin@gmail.com<b>FORWARD</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the great works that the Holy Spirit is accomplishing in the Christian community today is that of restoring Biblical understanding of the dynamics of God's kingdom. Ecclesiastical triumphalism has for far too long narrowed the kingdom focus to the work of the Church. This perspective has resulted in personal and organizational kingdom building while God's kingdom has lacked promotion and advancement.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Leaves from the Olive Tree Dr. Howard Morgan has provided the body of Messiah with a valuable anthology of various seminal essays that have emerged from his deep thought and prayer on important issues restoring kingdom perspectives to Christian thinking and lifestyle. His provocative insights will help you recover the mind of Christ, the service mentality that seeks to facilitate and augment the gifts of God in the lives of your fellow believers.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Morgan is one of those unique individuals who is able to combine superb scholarship with incisive spiritual insight that produces balanced, theologically sound teaching upon which believers can build solid, mature, Christ-centered lives.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Morgan gives us some valuable keys for restoring the Jewish roots of Christian faith and recovering a Biblical relationship between the Church and the Jewish people.&nbsp; What has to long been lacking in an over-Hellenized, over-Latinized Church will be brought into focus for you in understanding the Hebraic foundations of the gospel of Christ. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These essays also offer sound suggestions for eradicating the Church's historical anti-Judaism and anti-Semitism. A horrible record of persecution against the Jewish people must be addressed in repentance and renewal of a right spirit in the corporate community of Christian faith.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you read (and reread) these insights, your spirit will soar into the dimension of the purposes of God. Opportunities for participation in divine imperatives will become apparent. Most of all, you will be challenged to deepen your relationship with the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Peter, James, and John, the God who still seeks those who will worship him in Spirit and truth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us together seek the walk in Spirit that will bring us into an intimate, personal, face-to-face relationship with the God of the universe through Jesus the Messiah.<br> &nbsp;<br> John D.

He lives in Berlin, Germany.I walked over to Lea and drew her gently to me, the same movement as ever when I needed to console and protect her. Then she would press her cheek to my hip, and if things were particularly bad she would bury her face in me. Now, however, it was different, and even though it was only a small movement, a mere nuance in her reaction, it still changed the world. Under the gentle pressure of my hand Lea slowly returned to reality. At first she yielded, as she normally did, to my protective gesture. But then, for a tiny moment, she paused abruptly and began to resist me.<br>I sensed what was happening, and it hit me like an electric shock: while she had been immersed in herself a new will had formed, a new independence had come into being, one of which she was still unaware.<br>I drew my hand back with a start, fearfully waiting for what would happen next. Since coming to, Lea had not yet looked at me. When our eyes met now, it was for a moment which I experienced with unnatural alertness, like the encounter between two adults with matching wills. The person standing here was no longer a little daughter in need of protection, facing her tall, protective father, but a young woman filled with a will and a future for which she demanded unconditional respect.</p><h2>The Book of Frank Herbert</h2><p>1st edition 1st printing paperback, fine In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p><b>Frank Herbert</b> was born in Tacoma, Washington, and educated at the University of Washington, Seattle.

Since the early days of the 13th century, when carols began to be recorded in the vernacular, and at the same time losing touch with their Latin moorings, this music form would ultimately spread throughout all of Europe, the New World, and other parts of the Christian globe. Today, in fact, carols are mostly considered a Christmas phenomenon, and although they were once sung for other occasions, including birthdays and weddings, this publication looks at them purely from their association with the Christmas season. As the first of a planned series of book/audio products titled THE MILLENNIA COLLECTION: Glorious Christmas Music, Songs, and Carols, a landmark collection highly acclaimed by William E.

A major keystone in the evolution of land plants, the first seeds appeared some 360 million years ago. Since then they have developed into highly sophisticated propagules that have enabled plants to dominate the Earth&#x2019;s surface and conquer almost every possible habitat from the Antarctic to the hottest deserts. The diversity of shapes and sizes encountered in seeds is nearly endless and ranges from the impressive Seychelles nut at twenty kilos to the dustlike seeds of the orchids. No matter how small, packed into every seed is the complete genetic information needed to give rise to a new plant, whether it is a tiny herb or a giant rainforest tree. True time capsules of life, seeds may travel thousands of miles and, if necessary, wait for hundreds of years before germinating.<br></p><p>Wolfgang Stuppy is the seed morphologist at the Millennium Seed Bank Project, an international initiative dedicated to seed conservation managed by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.

Never one to shy from challenges, Garry Knox Bennett has for more than 30 years been one of America's most important and influential furniture makers. This full color, 96 page catalogue is a beautiful companion to the exhibition Garry Knox Bennett: Call Me Chairmaker , which debuted at the Bellevue Arts Museum, and featured 52 chairs which exemplify Bennett's boisterous bravado and professed disdain for validated technical and artistic practices. The works in Call Me Chairmaker also reveal the essence of Bennett's artistic personality and his passion for pursuing the many possibilities the chair presents. Inspired by past and present famous architects and designers of chairs, Bennett lets his raucous humor, sly wit, and visual puns dance with full abandonment. His free-spirited, irreverent oeuvre forsakes not only conventional principles of art and design but, even more, the canons of furniture craftsmanship. <p>Includes essays by Deputy Head of Research from Victoria and Albert Museum, Glenn Adamson, art critic and philosopher Arthur C.

More so than after World War II, Wilson and his contemporaries engaged in a wide-ranging debate about the fundamental character of American national security in the modern world. <em>The Will to Believe</em> is the first book that examines that debate in full, offering a detailed analysis of how U.S. political leaders and opinion makers conceptualized and pursued national security from 1914 to 1920.</p> <p>Based on extensive research gleaned from public documents, presidential papers, and periodicals, <em>The Will to Believe</em> departs significantly from existing scholarship, which tends to examine only Wilson or his critics. This is the first study of America&#x2019;s approach to the war, which examines all major U.S. perspectives from across the political spectrum and analyzes Wilson&#x2019;s security strategy from the beginning of U.S. neutrality through the end of his presidency. During World War I there was no consensus among Wilson and his contemporaries on such fundamental issues as the nature of the international system, the impact of security policies on domestic freedom, the value of alliances and multinational organizations, and the relationship between democracy and peace. Historian Ross A. Kennedy focuses on how three competing groups&#x2015;pacifists, liberal internationalists, and Atlanticists&#x2015;addressed these and other national security issues.</p></p><p><strong>Ross A.

Here for the first time is a SEAL insider&#x2019;s battle history of these Special Operations warriors in the war on terrorism. <br><br>&#x201c;Down range&#x201d; is what SEALs in Afghanistan and Iraq call their area of operations. In this new mode of warfare, &#x201c;down range&#x201d; can refer to anything from tracking roving bands of al-Qaeda on a remote mountain trail in Afghanistan to taking down an armed compound in Tikrit and rousting holdouts from Saddam Hussein&#x2019;s regime. It could mean interdicting insurgents smuggling car-bomb explosives over the Iraqi-Syrian border or silently boarding a freighter on the high seas at night to enforce an embargo. In other words, &#x201c;down range&#x201d; could be anywhere, anytime, under any conditions. <br><br>In <i>Down Range</i>, author Dick Couch, himself a former Navy SEAL and CIA case officer, uses his unprecedented access to bring the reader firsthand accounts from the warriors in combat during key missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Couch creates a pulse-pounding, detailed narrative of the definitive engagements of this war, while painting an unusually intimate portrait of these warriors in the field. The performance of the SEALs in difficult, changing environments&#x2014;in the heat of the Afghan desert, in the snow-packed Hindu Kush, on the high seas, and in the urban chaos of Baghdad&#x2014;has been nothing short of extraordinary. The SEALs, coordinating with other American forces, the CIA, and foreign special operations units like the Polish GROM, have once more shown their genius for improvisation and capacity for courageous action in leading the fight against this new and vicious enemy. <br><br>The first battle history of its kind, <i>Down Range</i> is a riveting close-up of some of America&#x2019;s finest warriors in action against a deadly foe.<br>Also available as an eBook</p><p>Dick Couch is the author of <i>The Warrior Elite: The Forging of SEAL Class 228</i> and <i>The Finishing School: Earning the Navy SEAL Trident</i>, as well as six novels. He commanded a SEAL platoon in Vietnam that conducted one of the few successful POW rescue operations of the war. He lives in central Idaho.CHAPTER 1 <br><br>THE WARRIORS <br><br>Basic and Advanced Skills <br><br>Navy SEALs are a curious breed of warriors. They are special, but what makes them so? How do they get that way? Before delving into the specifics of SEAL operations, we need to look at the organization that projects this force and puts them in the fight&#x2014;how they are organized and trained, and how they are deployed around the world for operational taskings. Because the battle is different today than in the past, the lengthy process that prepares SEALs for battle dramatically changed in the last few years. <br><br>If you have read my prior works on the Navy SEALs, <i>The Warrior Elite </i>and <i>The Finishing School</i>, you already have a good idea of how SEALs are made. You have to understand the animal and his training before you can understand how he hunts and moves in a hostile environment. SEAL training today is the culmination of an ongoing, evolutionary process of testing and training that in the end produces a unique warrior, one who can trace his roots to the Navy frogmen in World War II. Those hastily trained volunteers went ashore in Sicily, Normandy, and the beaches of the western Pacific Ocean ahead of the amphibious landing forces. On Omaha Beach alone, more than half of the men who preceded the invasion force were killed or wounded. Two key philosophies have endured from the days of making Navy frogmen to the current practice in the making of Navy SEALs&#x2013;doctrines that are unique in military training and other special operations training. <br><br>The first is a philosophy of selection. Those aspiring to become Navy SEALs are put through a harsh and efficient process that quickly reveals the right kind of men for this work-men who would rather die than quit. In the early days, volunteers were immediately thrust into a week of intense physical hardship and virtually denied any sleep. Those who survived were trained in demolitions and hydrographics, formed into teams, and sent ashore to recon and clear the landing beaches. This philosophy of "train the best, discard the rest" became the cornerstone of Navy frogman training, and, later, SEAL training. This Indoctrination Week quickly became known as Hell Week, or, during times of political correctness, Motivation Week. It survives in much of its original format to this day. The frogmen who trained for clearing beaches at Saipan and Iwo Jima can swap similar Hell Week stories with SEALs coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. In many ways, it is a rite of passage. Early in SEAL training, candidates must not only survive, but perform continuously as a team, for five days with no more than five hours of sleep. During these brutal five days, they are cold, wet, and sandy the entire time. Most who begin this challenging week do not finish it. They simply quit. Those who do make it through are candidates to become Navy SEALs. <br><br>The second legacy from the frogman days of World War II is the belief that officers and enlisted men should train side by side. The pain, cold water, and lack of sleep are shared equally. The only distinction is that officers and senior enlisted petty officers are held to a higher standard of leadership. <br><br>While there is a sense of continuity between those first frogmen and today's SEALs, there are also some key differences between modern SEALs and their predecessors. One difference in the making of a modern SEAL is the length of time in training. During World War II, men were trained in a matter of a few months and rushed off to combat. Immediately following their Hell Week, they were given basic demolition training and deployed overseas. During Vietnam, training consisted of the basic training course, which had by then become BUD/S (Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL) Training. BUD/S was then a four-month course. The advanced training that a young warrior would need to survive in combat was conducted at his SEAL team by returning team veterans. In less than a year, a young sailor or newly commissioned officer could be on patrol in the Mekong Delta. Today, few SEALs deploy without three years of training. They are now trained to a professional standard that is rigorous and exacting. I'm often asked if training is harder today than in my time-when being a SEAL guaranteed you were going to Vietnam. In deference to the SEALs of my era, I'll not surrender any of the ground we might claim in the "tough" category, but I can say this without reservation: Those of us from previous generations would have to take our game to a much higher professional level to meet current Navy SEAL standards. To take an analogy from professional basketball, could Jerry West or Bob Cousy guard Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant? I don't think so. They, like the SEALs of my generation, were perhaps the best of their era. However, the bar has been raised. This is a new game with new standards of excellence and professionalism. One thing that is unchanged in the experience of frogmen of World War II, the Vietnam-era SEALs of my generation, and the SEALs on deployment today is this: If you are a Navy SEAL, with some exceptions, you will go in harm's way; your deployments will be combat deployments. If you are a Navy SEAL today, you will literally be putting your gun in the fight. When I was the OIC (officer in charge) of Whiskey Platoon, SEAL Team One in 1970, I distinctly remember telling my platoon SEALs, "This will be an active combat deployment. You're all volunteers. If anyone doesn't want to do this, come see me later, and I'll see that you get a set of orders to another duty station." They all chose to go with me on deployment because they wanted their gun in the fight, and I brought them all home. It was an achievement in which I still take a great deal of pride. The credit, however, goes to the professionalism of my SEALs and the enlisted leadership of my platoon. <br><br>The making of a Navy SEAL today is the construction of a triangle. This triangle is sketched or lightly drawn during basic SEAL training. The lines of the triangle are more firmly outlined during advanced training, and still more deeply etched during predeployment training. The life of a Navy SEAL is a life of training-the tracing and retracing of this triangle. One side of the triangle is conditioning-physical and mental. SEALs live with a diet of running, swimming, and constant physical training. This physical dimension and shared experience of Hell Week serve to build a mental reservoir against the times when conditions are unbearably harsh and day upon day might pass without sleep. A Navy SEAL knows he's been there before; he must always maintain the physical and mental conditioning to be able to go there again-any time and without advanced warning. You often hear a SEAL describe a difficult operation down range as "It was hard and we were cold, but it wasn't Hell Week cold." The second side of the triangle is professionalism. Training and learning are never over. Throughout his career, a SEAL must continue to refine and upgrade his professional skill set. The skills learned during basic and advanced training are not good enough for operational deployment. The skill level of a SEAL on his first deployment is less than what is expected of him on his third deployment. The life of a SEAL is one of professional evolution-a continuous cultivation of a special operations skill set. Many things remain the same and must be practiced again, but new skills have to be learned to meet emerging enemy capabilities. The final part of the triangle is the base, which represents character. To be a fully formed SEAL warrior, a man must develop a firm moral platform from which to project his power. The Navy core values of honor, courage, and commitment are part of the equation. There is also the short list of discipline, integrity, trust, and personal accountability. The development of character and the maintenance of personal honor are as important as the physical and professional components in creating a Navy SEAL. <br><br>Now let's talk about the mechanics of training Navy SEALs. The first challenge that an aspiring sailor or young officer must face is Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL Training-BUD/S. It is the BUD/S experience that defines the SEAL culture and forms the glue that binds all SEALs together, from seaman to admiral. It is a thirty-week course that separates those who think they want to become a Navy SEAL from those who are willing to pay the price to achieve that goal. There has always been a debate about BUD/S: Is it training-a course of instruction-or simply a testing or screening process? From my close observation of BUD/S Class 228, which was featured in <i>The Warrior Elite</i>, and subsequent BUD/S training, I believe it is both. Skills learned during BUD/S provide the foundation for the diverse warrior skill set that all SEALs must develop. These skills are mixed in with a daunting physical regime throughout the BUD/S curriculum. The seven-and-a-half month BUD/S course is conducted at the Naval Special Warfare Center at Coronado, California. <br><br>BUD/S is conducted in three separate and distinct phases preceded by a four-to-six-week Introduction Course, or Indoc. This introductory period is a mix of running, swimming, and physical training, or PT. The new trainees are introduced to the obstacle course. They learn about cold water by spending extended periods in the Pacific Ocean. Few have been teeth-rattling, to-the-bone cold, but they get a taste of this in the Indoctrination Course. This course is to prepare BUD/S trainees for First Phase training. About 20 percent will voluntarily drop from training during Indoc. There are a few injuries, and some will quit from the pain of the moment-but most quit because they now understand that the long, tiring days and the cold water will go on for months and months. Indeed, long days and physical hardship are the life of a Navy SEAL. Indoc also introduces the trainees to the protocols and routines that have evolved from the early days to what is now modern BUD/S training. <br><br>First Phase is the conditioning phase; the physical regime is ta...</p><h2>The Dirty Secrets Club (Jo Beckett)</h2><p>In the wake of an ongoing string of high-profile murder-suicides in San Francisco, forensic psychiatrist Jo Beckett is hired by the SFPD to perform investigative autopsies and discovers a harrowing commonality among the suicide victims. 60,000 first printing.</p><p><p> <b>MEG GARDINER</b>is the author of eleven critically acclaimed no</p><b>Chapter 1</b><p>Fire alarms sang through the skyscraper, piercing and relentless.

"Everything crashed off the bookshelves. I thought for sure it was the Big One."</p><p>The man turned, shoulders shifting. The Big One? Hardly. This earthquake had just been San Francisco's regular kick in the butt. But it was bad enough. On the street, steam geysered from manholes. And he could smell gas.

"Security cameras?"</p><p>"Only in the stairwells. It's bad business for a law firm to videotape its clients."</p><p>She nodded at a wall of windows. The October sunset was fading to dusk, downtown ablaze with light. "You plan to do this stunt against the glass?"</p><p>He crossed the lobby. "This way. The building's going to shut down in" he looked at a red digital clock on the wall "six minutes."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Emergency procedure. If there's a gas leak the building evacuates, they shut down the elevators and seal the fire doors. We have to be out by then."</p><p>"You're joking."</p><p>The wall clock counted down to 5:59. He started a timer on his watch.</p><p>"Yeah. I was meeting with my lawyers when the quake hit. It limits damage from any gas explosion." He pulled her toward a hallway. "I can't believe you're scared of getting caught with me. Not Hardgirl."</p><p>"What part of <i>secret</i> do you not you understand?"</p><p>"If we're caught, they'll ask what we're doing here, not what we're hiding in our pasts."</p><p>"Fair point." She hurried alongside him, eyes bright. "Were you waiting for an earthquake before you did this?"</p><p>Good guess this was the third minor quake in the past month. "I got lucky. I've been looking for the perfect opportunity for weeks. Chaos, downtown it was karma. I figured seize the day."</p><p>He rounded a corner. A glass-fronted display case along the wall had cracked, spilling sports memorabilia on the floor.</p><p>She rushed past. "Is that a Joe Montana jersey?"</p><p>His stopwatch beeped. "Five minutes."</p><p>He opened a mahogany door. Across a conference room the red embers of sunset caught them in the eyes. The hills of San Francisco rose in front of him, electric with light and packed to the rafters, like a stadium.</p><p>He shrugged off his coat, took a camera from the pocket and handed it to her. "When I tell you, point and click."</p><p>He crossed the room and opened the doors to a rooftop terrace. Kicking off his shoes, he strode outside.</p><p>"You complained I was using the club as a confessional. You told me I was seeking expiation for my sins, but said you couldn't give me absolution," he said.</p><p>Deep below them, the building groaned. She walked outside, breathing hard.</p><p>"Damn, Scott, this is dangerous "</p><p>"Your dare was and I quote for me 'to offer a public display of penitence, and for christsake get proof.'"</p><p>He pulled his polo shirt over his head.

He unzipped and dropped his jeans.</p><p>She gaped.</p><p>He backed toward the waist-high brick wall at the edge of the terrace. "Turn on the camera."</p><p>"You came commando-style to a meeting with your lawyers?"</p><p>Naked, he climbed onto the brick ledge and stood up, facing her. Her lips parted. Thrilled to his fingertips, he turned to face Montgomery Street.</p><p>A salt breeze licked his bare skin. Two hundred feet below, fire and police lights flickered through steam boiling from the ruptured pipe, turning the scene an eerie red.</p><p>He spread his arms. "Shoot."</p><p>"You have got to be kidding me."</p><p>"Take the photo. Hurry."</p><p>"That's not penitent."</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder. She was shaking her head.</p><p>"<i>Bad</i>? You tattooed <i>Bad</i> on your tailbone?"</p><p>His watch beeped. "Four minutes. Do it."</p><p>"You're a badass?" She put her fists on her hips. "You get all torn up about a nasty thing you did in college, and want to unload it on us fine. But you can't tattoo some preening jock statement on your butt and call it repentance. That's not remorse. Hell, it's not even close to being dirty."</p><p>Frowning, she stormed inside.</p><p>He turned around. "Hey!"</p><p>Was she leaving? No, everything depended on her getting the photo </p><p>She ran back out, holding a piece of sports memorabilia from the display case.</p><p>It was a jockey's riding crop. He swallowed.</p><p>She whipped it against a potted plant with a wicked crack. "Somebody needs to take you down a notch."</p><p>He nearly whimpered. She wanted points, too. This was even better.</p><p>Snapping the crop against her thigh, she crossed the terrace. Evaluating the ledge, she unzipped her ass-hugging skirt, wriggled it down, and stepped out of it.</p><p>"It's time to make your act of contrition," she said.</p><p>In the tight-fitting black jacket, she looked martial.

"I get paid four million dollars a year to catch things and never let them drop."</p><p>A wisp of her blond hair had escaped. It softened her. He wanted her to put it back in place. He wanted her to put on leather gloves and maybe an eye patch. He pulled her up on the ledge beside him.</p><p>She gripped his hand. Her smooth stocking brushed his leg.</p><p>He could barely speak. "This is penance?"</p><p>"Pain is just one step from paradise."</p><p>She looked down. Her voice dropped. "Christ. This is asking for a heart attack."</p><p>"Don't joke."</p><p>She looked up. "No I didn't mean it as a crack about David."</p><p>But if David hadn't dropped facedown with a coronary, they wouldn't be here. The doctor's death had created an opening, and Scott wanted to fill it. This was his chance to prove himself and gain admission to the top level of the club.</p><p>The breeze kicked up. In the lighted windows of the skyscraper across the street, people gazed down at the fire trucks. Nobody was looking at them.</p><p>"Right under their noses," he said. "Bonus points for both of us."</p><p>"Not yet." She handed him the camera. "Set it so we're both in the frame."</p><p>He set the auto timer to take a five-shot series and posed the camera on the ledge. His stopwatch beeped. Three minutes.</p><p>She planted her feet wide for balance. "What happens to guilty people?"</p><p>Blinking, he turned around and carefully knelt down on all fours. "I've been bad. Spank me."</p><p>She slapped the crop against her palm. "What's the magic word?"</p><p>Relief and desire rushed through him. "Hard."</p><p>The camera flashed. She brought the crop down.</p><p>The pain was a stripe of fire along his backside. He gasped and grabbed the ledge.</p><p>"Harder," he said.</p><p>She whipped the crop down. The camera flashed.</p><p>He clawed the bricks. "Mea culpa. I've been very, very bad. More."</p><p>She didn't hit him. He looked up. Her chest was heaving, her hair spilling from the French twist.</p><p>"My God, you actually want to be punished, don't you?" she said.</p><p>"Do it."</p><p>She swung the crop. It slashed him so hard he shouted in pain. She wanted to dish out punishment, all right, but not to him. She would use this to send a message to somebody else. The watch beeped.</p><p>"Christ, two minutes," she said. "Let's get the hell out of here."</p><p>His eyes were watering. "Not yet. Nobody's looking."</p><p>"<i>Looking</i>? You're nuts.

Landed like a gazelle on her stilettos. He scrambled after her, buttocks stinging. They grabbed their clothes and ran for the door. The chopper rotated in the air, searchlight sweeping after them.</p><p>She looked back, her eyes brimming with joy and fury. The searchlight lit her hair like a halo.</p><p>"Turn around," he shouted. "You want them to get a close-up?"</p><p>"The city knows your face, not mine."</p><p>"But it's about to know your glorious ass."</p><p>He ran into the conference room, stopped and wrangled his left leg into his jeans. The spotlight caught them. He bumbled for the door.</p><p>Fumbling her way into her skirt, she sprinted into the hallway. "It's chasing us like those things from the damned <i>War of the Worlds</i>."</p><p>He urged her forward. "Take the service elevator. The lobby downstairs is full of cops."</p><p>She ran beside him, agile in the heels. His watch beeped.</p><p>"Oh, crap. No time."</p><p>In the lobby, the fire alarm wailed a high-pitched tone. The digital clock flashed red: :58, :57. The TV news was showing pictures from the chopper's camera.</p><p>"Two people are trapped on the roof," shouted the reporter. "A woman was signaling for help. If we swing around...;"</p><p>The alarm rose in pitch.</p><p>"How long to get down?" she said.</p><p>They ran to the service elevator and she pounded on the button. The searchlight panned along the windows. Like a white flare, it caught them in the eyes.</p><p>"I see them. They're attempting to escape from this deadly tower...;"</p><p>She whacked the elevator button with the riding crop. "<i>Open</i>."</p><p>With a <i>ping</i>, the elevator arrived. She dropped the crop and they lunged inside.</p><p>On the ground floor they burst out a back exit into an alley. The asphalt was wet and steaming. Scott clicked his stopwatch.</p><p>"Seven seconds. Time to spare."</p><p>"Maniac," she said.</p><p>They dashed through puddles toward the end of the alley. On the street a police car blew past, lights flashing. The helicopter thumped overhead, searchlight pinned on the roof.</p><p>Scott nodded at it. "They got it on tape. You have evidence."</p><p>"You're reckless. I think you actually want to get caught."</p><p>"I carried out the dare. Did I make the cut?"</p><p>She fought with her zipper. "We'll put it to a vote. No promises."</p><p>They rushed out of the alley. The street, lined with banks and swanky stores, was being cleared by the police. They slowed to a walk, trying to look normal. He buttoned his jacket. She smoothed down her hair.</p><p>Elation flooded him.</p><p>"Admit it that was awesome."</p><p>"It was outrageous." She pointed at him. "And do not tell me it ended with a flourish."</p><p>"Really?" He reached into his coat pocket and withdrew a baseball.</p><p>"What's that?"</p><p>He tossed it to her. She caught it.</p><p>"A Willie Mays autographed ball?" She looked up, surprised. "From the law firm's memorabilia collection? You stole it?"</p><p>"On our way out. And it's not just any baseball.

A Sigma Pro photographer, David presents seminars and workshops across North America to a wide variety of audiences. He lives in Bellville, OH.K-Gr 3-With vivid language and illustrations that reward careful looking, this book introduces readers to the life cycle of the spotted salamander, a colorful amphibian that lives in underground forest burrows and vernal pools that fill up in the late winter or early spring. The cycle begins when the spotted salamanders leave their underground homes and migrate to pools, where they "dance in the dark," lay their eggs, and, in time, return once again to their woodland hideaways. The poetic text makes this an excellent choice for reading aloud and for careful study. Words slide off the tongue ("Through slippery leaves, down muddy slopes, salamanders slide silently into the rising waters of their vernal pool."), and the repeated "Clack! Clack! Clack!" of the wood frogs will appeal to readers' sense of sound. Words such as vernal pool and metamorphosis are clearly explained. The illustrations support and extend the writing. A spread of the forest on a late winter evening, depicted with dramatic deep blues and greens, reveals, on close inspection, other animals-an owl and a muskrat-lurking nearby. The visuals also include a variety of perspectives, offering readers a view from the bottom of the vernal pool as well as a look down into the pool from the surrounding land. Some images zoom in to provide close-ups of salamander eggs and developing larvae or underground homes; others zoom out to present a view of the surrounding forest and other forest animals.

Her many awards include the Kate Greenaway Medal and the prestigious Eleanor Farjeon Award for her services to children's literature.Kindergarten-Grade 3-A small collection of three stories and six poems, all set in winter. Each selection is fresh and stands well on its own. The first is about an eight or nine-year-old girl sent to the coast to stay with a family friend while she recovers from an illness. Hughes incorporates a folktale about a selkie into it. In a wordless tale, a preschool boy takes a mysterious dream journey filled with strange, fairylike creatures, but remains oblivious to most of the action. After a couple of Christmas poems, there is a post-holiday selection about a boy and his grandfather who take down their tree and burn it. The old gent stokes the flames by adding his cache of personal letters and mementos. He explains to his grandson, "'The special things are in my head. And my heart. So why not get rid of the rest?'" The double-spread watercolor illustrations are large and vigorous, their mood appropriate for each piece. It is always a pleasure to look at Hughes's pictures of family life, with her realistic and average-looking people.

In recent years, however, the subject has begun to attract wide interest. As is evident from this volume, this period of roughly a century and a half produced an outpouring of art created in a bewildering number of genres and spanning a wide range of aims and accomplishments. <i>Since Meiji</i> is the first sustained effort in English to discuss in any depth a time when Japan, eager to join in the larger cultural developments in Europe and the U.S., went through a visual revolution. Indeed, this study of the visual arts of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries suggests a fresh history of modern Japanese culture&#x2015;one that until now has not been widely visible or thoroughly analyzed outside that country.<br><br>In this extensive collection, which includes some 190 black-and-white and color reproductions, scholars from Japan, Europe, Australia, and America explore an impressive array of subjects: painting, sculpture, prints, fashion design, crafts, and gardens. The works discussed range from early Meiji attempts to create art that referenced Western styles to postwar and contemporary avant-garde experiments. There are, in addition, substantive investigations of the cultural and intellectual background that helped stimulate the creation of new and shifting art forms, including essays on the invention of a modern artistic vocabulary in the Japanese language and the history of art criticism in Japan, as well as an extensive account of the career and significance of perhaps the best-known Japanese figure concerned with the visual arts of his period, Okakura Tenshin (1862&#x2013;1913), whose <i>Book of Tea</i> is still widely read today.<br><br>Taken together, the essays in this volume allow readers to connect ideas and images, thus bringing to light larger trends in the Japanese visual arts that have made possible the vitality, range, and striking achievements created during this turbulent and lively period.<br><br><b>Contributors:</b> Stephen Addiss, Chiaki Ajioka, John Clark, Ellen Conant, Mikiko Hirayama, Michael Marra, Jonathan Reynolds, J.

She loves going for walks, whether it is sunny or cold &#x2014; long, wandering walks where her wellies take her. Follow Pippa into the beautiful countryside as her day unfolds, and the wildlife, animals, and people she encounters are complemented by relevant poems from some of our greatest authors, personally chosen by Clare and Michael Morpurgo. Part poetry anthology, part children&#x2019;s scrapbook, this is a truly lavish project designed to instill a love of language in young children.</p><p><b>Michael Morpurgo </b>is one of the U.K.&#x2019;s best-loved authors and a former Children&#x2019;s Laureate.

She lives in Northumberland, England.Gr 3-6&#x2013;This illustrated, journal-style story is comprised of Pippa's observations as she takes a walk around a small English village. Her handwritten notes are enhanced by poems and illustrations of the places, people, and animals she sees; as the youngster sets off, the accompanying poem by John Masefield, &#x201c;Tewkesbury Road,&#x201d; appropriately begins, &#x201c;It is good to be out on the road,/and going one knows not where....&#x201d; Christina Rossetti, Ted Hughes, Walter de la Mare, and Robert Browning are among the other poets included. The child is a keen observer and explorer and shares important knowledge she has learned, like how to walk through a field of cows without disturbing them. On foot and on horseback, she records her encounters with spiders and chickens, a fisherman, and a farmer on a tractor. The verses have been placed to complement Pippa's musings, and this combination makes for a lovely one-on-one read-aloud or an unintimidating introduction to poetry. The book has the look of a nature journal/scrapbook, with layered, collagelike illustrations, primarily in browns and grays, on every page. Pippa's notes are written in cursive throughout, which may prove challenging to younger readers. This lovely, unusual book might not immediately find a broad audience, but with help, the right readers will appreciate it.&#x2013;Marian McLeod, Darien Library, CT&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

The commentaries were thought to have been written by Ambrose throughout the Middle Ages, but their authorship was challenged by Erasmus, whose arguments have proved decisive. Here for the first time Ambrosiaster&#39;s commentaries on Romans and the Corinthian correspondence are made available in English translation, ably translated and edited by Gerald L. Bray. The commentaries, which serve as important witnesses to pre-Vulgate Latin versions of Paul&#39;s epistles, are noteworthy in other respects as well. Ambrosiaster was a careful and thoughtful interpreter, with little use for allegory, though he employed typology judiciously. Writing during the pontificate of Damasus (366-384), he is a witness to Nicene orthodoxy and frequently comments on themes related to the Trinity, the consubstantiality of the Son, the problem of the unbelief of the Jews and the nature of human sinfulness. He had a keen eye for moral issues and often offers comments that reflect his knowledge of how the church had changed from the time of the apostles to his own day. This commentary offers a rich repository of insight into the thinking of pre-Reformation church leaders for the leaders and teachers of the church today.</p><p><strong>Gerald L.

From his childhood in Illinois, where a slave girl implanted in him a fear of ghosts, to his attendance at West Point, along with other future luminaries, to his service on the frontier (where he took particular note of the bearing of the Cheyenne), Hardin&#x2019;s life reveals the progress of a century. <br><br>Abraham Lincoln was a close friend and political ally of Martin&#x2019;s father, who died a hero in the Mexican War. The family were also relatives of Mary Todd. Made Brigadier General at age 27, Hardin fought with distinction at Malvern Hill, Second Manassas, Gettysburg, Grant&#x2019;s Overland Campaign, and the July 1864 Rebel raid on Washington. He was wounded four times, nearly died on two occasions, and lost an arm during the war. On one occasion he was ambushed on a road by Mosby&#x2019;s men, one of whom may have been Lincoln conspirator Lewis Paine. Hardin himself took part in the hunt for John Wilkes Booth after Lincoln&#x2019;s assassination.<br><br>In these pages we also learn the prominent role of General Hardin&#x2019;s mother, who acted as her son&#x2019;s lobbyist in the heady social world of wartime Washington. Over four years, she skillfully played upon her friendship with the President and the First Lady to advance her son&#x2018;s career. Although, as we see in these pages, his gallantry and leadership in combat sufficed enough to earn him renown, and in this book the under-sung exploits of a true 19th-century hero are finally revealed.<br><br>Nominated for the Gilder Lehrman Prize<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Introduction: An Epic Life<br>Prologue: Lincoln Remembered, 1909<br><br>1.

His fascinating new book, Lincoln's Bold Lion: The Life and Times of Brigadier General Martin Davis Hardin, breaks new ground into the life of the boyish brigadier and examines his relationship with the 16th president of the United States.

A neglected, overweight, sexually abused child who was shuttled from one family to another, she became a teenage mother on welfare living in the projects of a major urban city. Vanzant took control of her life when she walked out of her second abusive marriage and entered Medgar Evers College in New York and then the City University of New York Law School. She moved to Philadelphia with her children and became a public defender for three years. Then she eventually became an ordained minister, who was committed to a message based on the principles of divine power and self-determination. </p><p>Iyanla combined her professional skills with her life's lessons and embarked on a writing and speaking career. Her mass appeal is evident in her overwhelming success as an author. <i>In the Meantime</i> was a #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, where it spent 20 weeks on the list, and she has had numerous other major bestsellers. As a nationally recognized speaker she has sold out such prestigious venues as New York's Jacob Javits Convention Center, Nashville's Grand Ole Opry, Atlanta's Civic Center, and the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles. Vanzant is also familiar to the daytime TV audience from her role as a regular contributor on "The Oprah Winfrey Show." </p><p>Acclaimed journalist and producer Barbara Walters recognized Vanzant's extraordinary appeal, seeing in her a "breakaway talent" with the potential for huge success in daytime television. With Walters and partner Bill Geddie on board to executive produce, Buena Vista Productions to develop the show, and Buena Vista Television as distributor, the road to <i>Iyanla</i> was forged. </p><p>Vanzant has received numerous accolades for her work. In 1992 Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley named October 21st "Tapping the Power Within Day" in honor of a workshop she presented in that city for African-American women. In 1994, the National Association of Equal Opportunity in Education, an organization comprised of the presidents and administrators of the 117 predominantly Black colleges in the United States named her Alumni of the Year. She also was awarded an "Oni" by the International Congress of Black Women as one of the nation's unsung heroes, and she served as the national spokesperson for Literacy Volunteers of America in 1998. </p><p>In 1999 she was listed among the 100 Most Influential African-Americans by <i>Ebony</i> magazine.

There's undeniable energy (and a lot of exclamation points) in Vanzant's personal entreaties; she's fond of ringing but generic affirmations of God (who is "awesome," "magnificent," "amazing" and "a skilled negotiator") and self ("I praise my body! I love my body!"). "Every thought, every word, every action is a prayer," Vanzant says, but she still offers specifics: there are prayers for "Alignment with God" and for blessing married couples; to "Eliminate Tiredness or Exhaustion" and to give thanks. Her fervent desire for the Divine presence in every facet of life will be inspiring for many, but others might find her detailed invocations ("Teach me to monitor my thoughts and desires to ensure that they are filled with love, harmony and peace for myself and everyone in my life in all situations and under all circumstances"; "Please purge my agenda today. Take out of my life everything...that could possibly take my focus from you") a trifle demanding. Replete with "I" statements, many of her prayers seem self-absorbed; the longer, more reflective ones, such as "Prayer When Ending a Relationship" and "God's Promise" strike deeper chords. Vanzant's spirituality of is powerful and motivating, as is her rags-to-riches bio, but occasionally this volume seems as much about her as it is about God.

This great German Lutheran mystic and follower of Melanchthon aroused Calvinist hostility by his spirituality of Christ in the heart of man. He was deposed as pastor of Bedeborn for refusing to abide by the orders of his Calvinist duke. Inspired by Bernard of Clairvaux, Angela of Foligno, John Tauler and Thomas a Kempis, he later came to be venerated by the Pietists. <p>True Christianity is his principal mystical work and one of the most important in the Protestant tradition. He published the first book of this work, which is presented here, in 1605. He added three other books at a later date and two more were appended posthumously. Books two to six are represented in this volume by selected excerpts. </p><p>Peter Erb, Professor of English and Religion and Culture at Wilfred Laurier University, Canada, has translated and introduced the text. The volume includes a preface by Heiko Oberman, the eminent authority on Lutheran spirituality who is Director of the Institute for Medieval and Reformation History at the University of T�bingen, West Germany.</p></p><p>Johann Arndt (1555 - 1621) teologo luterano aleman.

The first book of the Trilogy, published in the midst of the &#34;fifty thousand incidents&#34; of the London blitz, maintains the hope that though &#34;we have no map;/ possibly we will reach haven,/heaven.&#34; Tribute to the Angels describes new life springing from the ruins, and finally, in The Flowering of the Rod - with its epigram, &#34;... pause to give/ thanks that we rise again from death and live&#34; - faith in love and resurrection is realized in lyric and strongly Biblical imagery.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Our Times</h2><p>Originally published in six volumes in the 1930s under the auspices of journalist Mark Sullivan, an abridged edition edited by the veteran CBS-TV journalist chronicles the social and political history of America from the 1890s to the 1920s and features two hundred illustrations. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>YA?Rather has distilled Sullivan's six-volume set into this single text, retaining key elements of the original language and material. After more than 60 years, the vibrancy of Sullivan's social, political, and economic commentary brings people and events from the 1890s to the late 1920s into crystal clarity. Students curious about what the average man of the day thought of such topics as flight, automobiles, Teddy Roosevelt, World War I, jazz, unions, Woodrow Wilson, or Nan Britton's The President's Daughter may think they have fallen back through time. Primary-source documents including archival visuals, political cartoons, direct quotes, and Sullivan's sharp journalist's observations (at times, first-hand reports) fill in the circumstances surrounding events. Students writing reports on Roosevelt, Taft, Wilson, and Harding will be privy to the passions, strengths, and failings of these men, their parties, and their impact on John Q. Public. Students working on social-history projects, especially decade research, will find lyrics and literature, education, household economics, and more to help them envision daily life during the 1920s. One man's selection from his and his nation's immediate past, with that same man's point of view and some of the biases of his time offers students valuable insight into another era.?Barbara Hawkins, Oakton High School, Fairfax, VA<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Sullivan, a muckraking journalist, confidant of Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Ford and a self-styled Progressive Republican, wrote a bestselling popular history of the United States covering the years 1900 to 1925 and published in six volumes between 1926 and 1936. CBS anchor Rather, author of four books, has abridged Sullivan's opus into a single hefty volume, adding a preface, a conclusion and a few section notes. Illustrated with 200 period photographs, political cartoons, drawings, ads and posters, Sullivan's robust chronicle is a stirring, lively saga of missed opportunity as America steps onto the world stage during WWI, then refuses to join the League of Nations, shirks its leadership role and retreats into the consumerism and isolation of the Roaring Twenties. Sullivan ably conveys the dizzying pace of change propelled by electricity, films, radio, railroads, automobiles, airplanes, advertising. His colorful account of American daily life is crammed with odd information on clothing styles, patent medicines, public amusements, dog ownership, popular songs. Roosevelt, Ford, Wilson, Andrew Carnegie, Upton Sinclair and John D. Rockefeller stride across a sprawling canvas that offers close-up views of the growth of Freudianism, public schooling, immigration, Sacco and Vanzetti, Hemingway, Sandburg, Mencken, the jazz age. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Art of Sculpture: Visual Arts (Voyages of Discovery No 7)</h2><p>An interactive exploration of sculpture through the ages includes fold-outs revealing hidden art treasures in an ancient Chinese tomb, reusable stickers that replace missing parts of the Parthenon, an acetate page depicting the stages of bronze casting, and more.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Simply Samplers: Easy Techniques for Hand Embroidery (NeedleKnowledge)</h2><p><p><b>Preview all 16 finished samplers in our exclusive Look Book!</b></p><p>A sampler is a project made from a "sampling" of different stitches or different motifs.

In honor of Star Wars'-or technically Episode IV: A New Hope-silver anniversary, Ballantine has released this handsome three-in-one hardcover edition sporting a cover by conceptual artist Ralph McQuarrie, who greatly influenced the look of the films, e.g., Vader's mask was his idea. Though Star Wars might seem like geek fan boy stuff, creator Lucas (all the novels are based on his initial treatments for the scripts) does use proven literary motifs: a coming-of-age story as well as a search for a father figure, with a talisman (daddy Darth's lightsaber) linking the generations, it is most importantly about redemption. Each of the novels also includes an introduction by Lucas. A quarter-century later, millions of fans worldwide remain ravenous for all things from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away; the new films rake in zillions, and print titles in the "expanded universe" (characters/plots not covered on-screen) are widely read.

But warfare at sea, which played a vital role in the First and Second Punic Wars, rarely receives the attention it deserves. And it is the monumental clashes of the Carthaginian and Roman fleets in the Mediterranean that are the focus of Christa Steinby's absorbing study. <br><br>She exploits new evidence, including the latest archaeological discoveries, and she looks afresh at the ancient sources and quotes extensively from them. In particular she shows how the Romans' seafaring tradition and their skill, determination and resourcefulness eventually gave them a decisive advantage. In doing so, she overturns the myths and misunderstandings that have tended to distort our understanding of Roman naval warfare.</p><p>Christa Steinby is a leading expert on the Roman navy, the Punic Wars and warfare at sea in the classical world. She has taught ancient and Roman history at the University of Turku and University College Cork. She has published many academic papers on aspects of naval warfare in the Roman world as well as a book on the Roman republican navy."Overall, Steinby&#x2019;s book provides a naval-centered view of the conflicts between Rome and Carthage, giving readers a perspective that is not common in modern treatments. The value of this volume should not be underestimated. It is to be recommended to lay-readers as well as to students, both of whom will no doubt find it very helpful; and to academics, too, there is value in seeking out Steinby&#x2019;s views on these ever-important wars."

It's what inspires armies, convicts criminals, and makes or breaks presidential candidates. And it isn't just the preserve of politicians. It's in the presentation to a key client, the half-time talk in the locker room, and the plea to your children to eat their vegetables. Rhetoric gives words power: it persuades and cajoles, inspires and bamboozles, thrills and misdirects. You have been using rhetoric yourself, all your life. After all, you know what a rhetorical question is, don't you?<br>In <i>Words Like Loaded Pistols</i>, Sam Leith traces the art of persuasion, beginning in ancient Syracuse and taking us on detours as varied and fascinating as Elizabethan England, Milton's Satanic realm, the Springfield of Abraham Lincoln and the Springfield of Homer Simpson. He explains how language has been used by the great heroes of rhetoric (such as Cicero and Martin Luther King Jr.), as well as some villains (like Adolf Hitler and Richard Nixon.)<p>Leith provides a primer to rhetoric's key techniques. In <i>Words Like Loaded Pistols</i>, you'll find out how to build your own memory-palace; you'll be introduced to the Three Musketeers: Ethos, Pathos and Logos; and you'll learn how to use chiasmus with confidence and occultation without thinking about it. Most importantly of all, you will discover that rhetoric is useful, relevant &#x2013; and absolutely nothing to be afraid of.</p></p><p><b>Sam Leith</b> is a former literary editor of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, and contributes regularly to the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>Prospect</i>, <i>Guardian</i>, <i>Evening Standard</i> and <i>Spectator</i>.

When it comes to Obama, Leith's scrutiny is painstaking and he is especially illuminating on Obama's debts to Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>The London Evening Standard</i> (UK)</b><br> In this entertaining work of scholarship, Sam Leith revives the powerful discipline of classical rhetoric.... Leith is a gifted listener, and will not only tell you that Friends, Romans, countrymen' is a swelling tricolon but also which power ballad's opening bars it most resembles (AC/DC's Back in Black: DUM! DUH-dum! DUH-dum-dum!')&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>The Observer</i> (UK)</b><br> Leith attempts to reclaim rhetoric with a breezy book that sprays around examples from history, politics and popular culture to outline the building blocks of public speech, flitting happily from Cicero to J-Lo, from Hitler to Homer Simpson.... Leith's often engaging examples lighten any sense of learning.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>The Financial Times</i> (UK)</b><br> It is through a welter of colloquial examples and eccentric line readings that the book really comes alive....

When Spelman hints at what she thinks of as the failure of her parents&#x2019; lives, he counters that &#x201c;in a good novel one doesn&#x2019;t look for a success story, but for a story that moves one with its human drama and richness of experience.&#x201d;</p><p>At their final meeting, Maxwell encourages her to tell her mother&#x2019;s story. <i>Missing </i>is Spelman&#x2019;s response to Maxwell&#x2019;s wisdom.

Along the way, she unravels mysteries of her family, including the fate of her long lost older brother.</p><p>Spelman skillfully draws the reader into the elation and sorrow that accompany the discovery of a family&#x2019;s past. A profoundly loving yet honest elegy, <i>Missing </i>is, like the woman it memorializes, complex and beautiful.</p></p><p>"Cornelia Spelman's gentle, lyrical prose belies the haunting nature of her story, a searing, honest search for the lost pieces of her family's story. &nbsp;<i>Missing</i> is a book that both comforts and astounds. &nbsp;It's memoir writing at its absolute finest."

As they search for a group of kidnapped children who have the gift of chantment, they must negotiate both the unforgiving desert and the even more treacherous Palace of Cobwebs, where they uncover the dreadful secret that holds the Empire together. Meanwhile, Darrow has broken away from the group to form a new alliance of his own. Can he still be trusted? In this book, Calwyn's quest for peace and justice has greater consequences than she ever could have imagined.</p><p>In this tightly woven sequel to <i>The Singer of all Songs,</i> Calwyn and Co., still flush from their success in defeating the evil sorcerer Samis, are now on their way to the Empire of Merithuros. There, they hope to rescue two small siblings who were stolen away from Heben, a fallen prince with a decidedly suspicious nature toward magic makers. Within the lighter-than-air walls of Merithuros&#x2019; Palace of Cobwebs, Calwyn finds the children she seeks, but also a terrible secret of how these children and many others have been used and abused by the Empire for their power of chantment. Meanwhile, Darrow, Calwyn&#x2019;s mysterious mentor and friend, has gone off on a lonely quest to decide the fate of the powerful ruby ring he pried from the dead Samis&#x2019;s finger. The two will finally meet again within the walls of the Black Palace, where Darrow will declare his feelings, and Calwyn will lose all she holds dear, in the dry desert world of the waterless sea.<p> <i>The Waterless Sea</i> is the rich centerpiece of the Chanters of Tremaris trilogy; answering questions raised in the first book, while piquing interest in the eagerly awaited third novel.

An international bestseller and translated into twelve languages, <i>Summerhouse, Later</i> heralds the arrival of one of Germanys most arresting new literary talents.</p><p>A restless man hopes to find permanence in the purchase of a summerhouse outside Berlin.

A successful and simplistic artist becomes inexplicably obsessed with an elusive and strangely sinister young girl.</p><p>Against the backdrop of contemporary Berlin, possibly Europe's most vibrant and exhilarating city, Hermann's characters are as kaleidoscopic and extraordinary as their metropolis, united mostly in a furious and dogged pursuit of the elusive specter of "living in the moment." They're people who, in one way or another, constantly challenge the madness of the modern world and whose dreams of transcending the ordinary for that "narrow strip of sky over the rooftops" are deeply felt and perfectly rendered.</p></p><p><p>Judith Hermann lives in Berlin, where she works as a freelance writer. <em>Summerhouse, Later</em> is her first book.</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Half a Life: A Novel</h2><p>In a narrative that moves with dreamlike swiftness from India to England to Africa, Nobel Laureate V. S. Naipaul has produced his finest novel to date, a bleakly resonant study of the fraudulent bargains that make up an identity.<br><br>The son of a Brahmin ascetic and his lower-caste wife, Willie Chandran grows up sensing the hollowness at the core of his father's self-denial and vowing to live more authentically. That search takes him to the immigrant and literary bohemias of 1950s London, to a facile and unsatisfying career as a writer, and at last to a decaying Portugese colony in East Africa, where he finds a happiness he will then be compelled to betray. Brilliantly orchestrated, at once elegiac and devastating in its portraits of colonial grandeur and pretension, <b>Half a Life</b> represents the pinnacle of Naipaul's career.</p><p><i>Half a Life</i> finds the veteran Booker and Nobel Prize-winning author V.S. Naipaul on familiar territory, blending autobiography and fiction in an exploration of the "half lives" of individuals brought up in the English colonies and educated in metropolitan cities. <p> Naipaul's protagonist is Willie Somerset Chandran, named after Somerset Maugham's encounter with Willie's father in the 1930s while traveling "to get material for a novel about spirituality." Willie travels to England for his education, where he becomes "part of the special, passing bohemian-immigrant life of London of the late 1950s." Willie soon realizes that his colonial background allows him to write short stories for well-meaning white liberals, and he begins "to understand that he was free to present himself as he wished" and that he could "remake himself and his past" through his writing. The effect is suffocating rather than liberating, and he marries a vaguely sketched "girl or young woman from an African country," who has read his one published book. Willie begins another "half life" in colonial Mozambique, where he soon tires of the domestic and sexual tedium of plantation life and flees to Germany, mournfully reflecting that "I have been hiding for too long."</p><p> This is classic Naipaul, with its effortless dissection of the damaging personal consequences of post-war decolonization, but its virtue seems its primary vice, as the novel feels like a conflation of several earlier Naipaul books, including <i>The Mimic Men</i> and the brilliant <i>A Bend in the River</i>. Consequently, some readers may well find that <i>Half a Life</i> reads more like half a novel. <i>--Jerry Brotton, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>"A masterpiece of implicitness . . . explicitly concerned with drawing out the metaphysical-private while keeping it embedded in society and history . . . The ironies in <i>Half a Life</i> wind like a fugue into infinity . . . Identity is an enigma . . . To make that sentiment breathe in the mouth of a living character, and then rise from the page with silent laughter, is a beautiful completion: the mark of a genius and a cause of unending delight."<br> --Lee Siegel, <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i><br><br>"As disquieting as anything [Naipaul] has ever written . . . His terse prose works, as always, to imply a world in a phrase."<br> --Michael Gorra, <i>New York Times Book Review<br></i><br>"A troubling novel, genuinely moving . . . disturbing in all the right ways . . . the scenes of social encounters are brilliant, set against the twilight of colonial rule . . . A stunning book, three continents, three journeys, the evergreen themes of caste and class, of growing up."<br> --Betsy Willeford, <i>Miami Herald</i><br><br>"Naipaul's style is so frank it seems intimate, and the awful characters are studied and well crafted. Behind the matter-of-fact style is a cuttingly ironic view of human relations . . . When Naipaul talks, we listen."<br> --Diane Mehta, <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i><br><br>"Naipaul is a master of English prose, and the prose of <i>Half a Life</i> is as clean and cold as a knife."<br> --J. M. Coetzee, New York Review of Books<br><br>"'Half a Life,' the fierce new novel by V. S. Naipaul, the new Nobel laureate, is one of those rare books that stands as both a small masterpiece in its own right and as a potent distillation of the author's work to date . . . It deftly combines Dickensian delight in character with political and social observation . . . while recounting with uncommon elegance and acerbity the coming of age of its hero, Willie Chandran ... Mr. Naipaul endows his story with the heightened power of a fable. With 'Half a Life' he has given us a powerful tale of one man's journey from childhood to middle age while at the same time creating a resonant parable about the convulsions of modern history, both the dying of old inequities and the rise of new illusions, and their spiritual legacy of homelessness and dislocation."<br>--Michiko Kakutani, <i>New York Times<br><br></i>"As sly and funny as anything Naipaul has written . . . He is still mining his richest obsessions . . . The classic that his new novel calls to mind is Voltaire's <i>Candide</i>. There is the same mocking simplicity of style, the same heartless elegance of design . . . Nobody who enjoys seeing English beautifully controlled should miss this novel."<br>--John Carey, <i>Sunday Times</i> <br><br>"A surprise and a pleasure . . . here, at last, is a work of pure imagination, though the themes are characteristic in their complex peculiarity . . . Naipaul has produced the most complex and demanding body of work of any post-war British writer . . . In sentences of great precision and balance, Naipaul reanimates the dilemmas of the late and post-colonial experience . . . He reminds us again of what a fine and unusual writer he is . . . In the canon of contemporary British writing he is without peer: a cold, clear-eyed prophet, a scourge of sentimentality, irrationalism and lazy left-liberal prejudices. Read him."<br>--Jason Cowley, <i>The Observer Review</i> <br><br>"Naipaul writes a prose as clean as a stripped wand, but however plain the language, the ideas it delivers are not. . . . He is still peerless as a deviser of the shocking icon. He builds a scene of metaphysical loss as compelling as any Renaissance canvas of the expulsion from paradise."<br>--Paula Burnett, <i>The Independent</i> <br><br>"No writer has written more tellingly about the vocation of writing than V. S. Naipaul. . . . this new novel, <i>Half a Life</i>, shows us that Naipaul's absorption in how he came to be a writer is still fresh. . . . The pages about London glow, and bear comparison with anything that Naipaul has done . . . Almost casually, but beautifully, achieved . . . Captures in miniature the exceptional trajectory of Naipaul's oeuvre-the figure of the father, the life of the writer, and, finally, an enquiry into the origins of the colonial landscape itself."<br>--Amit Chaudhuri, <i>Times Literary Supplement<br></i><br>"The foremost literary interpreter of the third world for a British and American readership."<br>--Maya Jaggi, <i>The Guardian</i> <br><br>"Genuinely powerful in a deeply politically incorrect way."<br>--Jonathan Bate, <i>Daily Telegraph<br></i><br>"Fresh . . . A novel with a purpose . . . Through the evocation of three continents and several decades, without calling on public events and purely through the narrative of a life, V. S. Naipaul gives us a moral tale which captures the evanescence of our times."<br>--Farrukh Dhondy, <i>Literary Review</i> <br><br>"Read it for its beautifully controlled English."<br>--<i>The Sunday Times</i> <br><br>"One of the world's greatest living novelists . . . A writer whose world-view has been characterised by rigorous inquiry . . . A fascinating study . . . Naipaul has thankfully lost none of his grace, style, or storytelling power in this beautiful novel."<br>--Stuart Price, <i>Independent</i> <br><br>"Like a series of musical variations, the novel that follows [the first lines] never departs from them in essence . . . This is brilliant, affecting stuff: the novel's melancholy drama is played out on the furthest margins of fiction, where things are recollected rather than observed."<br>--Rachel Cusk, <i>Evening Standard</i> <br><br>"Naipaul's first novel in six years is another installment in the extended fictional autobiography. . . . [This novel] may tell us more about the essential Naipaul than he has ever heretofore revealed. . . . The work of a master who has rarely, if ever, written better."<br>--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (starred review)</p><h2>Down in My Heart</h2><p>From 1942 to 1945, William Stafford was interned in camps for conscientious objectors in Arkansas and California for his refusal to be inducted into the U.S. Army.<br>Down in My Heart is an account of the relationships among the men in the camps and their day-to-day activities - fighting forest fires, building trails and roads, restoring eroded lands - and their earnest pursuit of a social morality rooted in religious and secular pacifist ideals. In his new introduction to the book, Kim Stafford calls them a "generation of seekers" working full time "to envision a way to avoid the next war."<br>First published in 1947, this "peace relic," as William Stafford later called his first book, offers a rich glimpse into a little-known aspect of the war and a fascinating look at the formative years of a major American poet.</p><p>William Stafford taught for thirty years at Lewis &amp; Clark College in Portland, Oregon.In a career that began at 46, Stafford (1914-1993) published 67 full-length collections and chapbooks of sharply observed verse, harvesting poems from his diligently carried out "Daily Writings." Rather than completely refining out the rougher work, this second attempt at selecting from Stafford's vast oeuvre quadruples the poem count of its predecessor, following the arc of a journeyman's career with its attendant excesses, successes and failures. Stafford, who after some itinerant years settled into a 30 year stay at Oregon's Lewis &amp; Clark college and a stint as the state's poet laureate, rendered the objects that came his way in ordinary language. Most striking, in hindsight, is the easy range of his intentionally limited set of linguistic pipes: from simmering violence and its attendant atmospherics ("Travelling Through the Dark"; "Not in the Headlines") to religious naturalism ("I crossed the Sierras in my old Dodge/ letting the speedometer measure God's kindness,/ and slept in the wilderness on the hard ground.") to elegy ("At the Grave of My Brother") and social history and commentary ("Is This Feeling about the West Real?"; "Our City is Guarded by Automatic Rockets"). Other poems offer delicate philosophical introspection, as in the familiar "Bi-focal": "So, the world happens twice--/ once what we see it as;/ second it legends itself/ deep, the way it is." Including 71 previously unpublished new poems, among them the poem Stafford wrote the day he died, this collection fully reacquaints us with a quiet, generous presence on the American poetic landscape.

The book&#39;s enduring appeal lies in the eloquent, prophetic voice of Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-1859), a French aristocrat who visited the United States in 1831. A thoughtful young man in a still-young country, he succeeded in penning this penetrating study of America&#39;s people, culture, history, geography, politics, legal system, and economy. Tocqueville asserts, I confess that in America I saw more than America; I sought the image of democracy itself, with its inclinations, its character, its prejudices, and its passions, in order to learn what we have to fear or hope from its progress.</p><p>"No better study of a nation's institutions and culture than Tocqueville's <b>Democracy in America</b> has ever been written by a foreign observer; none perhaps as good." <br>-- <i>The New York Times</i> <br> <br>Praise for the work of Joseph Epstein: <br> <br>"Epstein is one of the premier contemporary American essayists...What is so remarkable about Epstein as an essay writer is that he'll begin a discussion at some personal place...and end up in another place relevant to us all.

He moves so effortlessly from the amusingly personal to the broadly philosophical that it takes a moment before you realize how far out into the intellectual cosmos you've been taken."<br>--Tom Wolfe <br><br>"Joseph Epstein's essays no more need his identifying byline than Van Gogh's paintings need his signature. Epstein's style--call it learned whimsy--is unmistakable; for Epstein addicts, indispensable."<br>--George Will<br><br>"Joseph Epstein is the liveliest, most erudite and engaging essayist we have."</p> <p>--James Atlas<br><br>"If Epstein's ultimate ancestor is Montaigne, his more immediate master is Mencken.

In the shadow of King Arthur's Britain, one woman knows the truth that could save a kingdom from the hands of a tyrant...</b> <br>Ancient grudges, old wounds, and the quest for power rule in the newly widowed Queen Isolde's court. Hardly a generation after the downfall of Camelot, Isolde grieves for her slain husband, King Constantine, a man she secretly knows to have been murdered by the scheming Lord Marche -- the man who has just assumed his title as High King. Though her skills as a healer are renowned throughout the kingdom, in the wake of Con's death, accusations of witchcraft and sorcery threaten her freedom and her ability to bring Marche to justice. Burdened by their suspicion and her own grief, Isolde must conquer the court's distrust and superstition to protect her throne and the future of Britain. <br>One of her few allies is Trystan, a prisoner with a lonely and troubled past. Neither Saxon nor Briton, he is unmoved by the political scheming, rumors, and accusations swirling around the fair queen. Together they escape, and as their companionship turns from friendship to love, they must find a way to prove what they know to be true -- that Marche's deceptions threaten not only their lives but the sovereignty of the British kingdom. <br>In <i>Twilight of Avalon</i>, Anna Elliott returns to the roots of the legend of Trystan and Isolde to shape a very different story -- one based in the earliest written versions of the Arthurian tales -- a captivating epic brimming with historic authenticity, sweeping romance, and the powerful magic of legend.</p><p>A long time devotee of historical fiction and fantasy, Anna Elliott lives in the DC Metro area with her husband and two daughters.&nbsp; She is the author of <i>Twilight of Avalon</i> and <i>Dark Moon of Avalon</i>, the first two books in the Twilight of Avalon trilogy.&nbsp; Visit her at www.annaelliottbooks.com.<b></b><p><b> Chapter One </b> </p><p> The dead man's eyes were weighted with gold. From the chapel doorway, Isolde saw the coins wink and gleam in the light of the candles that burned on the altar above. Payment for the holy women who would ferry him across the waters to the Isle of Glass. Or perhaps only a means to keep the sightless eyes closed; this was a church, consecrated to the Christ-God, after all. The old ways would have no place here. </p><p> Isolde stood still, her eyes adjusting to the dimness of the place. Even the chapel at Tintagel smelled of the sea; the stones even here thrummed like a bard's harp with the echo of all the fortress's walls had seen. Of Uther the Pendragon defeating Duke Gorlois and winning the duke's wife Ygraine for his queen. Of the birth of Arthur, Lord of Battles. Arthur, who had ridden out from these walls to drive the Saxons back with blow after crushing blow, and so won peace in Britain, for a time. </p><p> And all of that, Isolde thought, ended here, now, with the death of this king. Constantine, Arthur's heir. </p><p> She had seen fighting men with spear or sword wounds turned putrid, so far gone that the arm or leg had to be taken off if the soldier's life was to be saved. She'd made the cuts herself, had held the hot knives to cauterize the severed limbs and stop the bleeding. And seen how, for a brief, blessed moment after the glowing metal touched their skin, the men were numb, immune from pain, before they fainted or started to scream. </p><p> It was the same with her now. </p><p> The autumn dusk was drawing in, carrying with it the salt-laden mist that drifted up jagged cliffs from the ocean below, and the chapel felt dank and chill. And maybe, Isolde thought, the peace was ended long ago, when Arthur himself fell. And all these last seven years have only been part of that same long, crumbling fall. </p><p> A shield, likewise bearing the bloodred badge of the Pendragon, rested on the dead man's chest, and on the floor all about the coffin lay the great battle-axes, the knives, the helmet with its royal circlet of gold, and the jeweled and gilded sword that he had once carried into battle. Isolde drew her cloak more closely about her. Then she stepped out of the shadow of the arched lintel above. </p><p> Instantly, the armed and helmeted guard to the left of the altar stiffened to attention, his hand moving reflexively to the hilt of his sword. His fellow, the broader, taller man of the two, had been standing at the side of the coffin, his back to Isolde, but at the sound of Isolde's footsteps he whirled to face her, as well. Isolde looked from one man to the other. Neither guard was known to her, but she recognized the emblem of the wild boar blazoned on their shields. </p><p> Marche's men. </p><p> She let the hood of her cloak slip to her shoulders, and saw them relax slightly, as they caught sight of her face. She could remember one of the older serving women telling her, with venomous sweetness, that she was the very image of what her grandmother had been when young. </p><p> The harpers' tales spoke of Morgan's fairness. Of raven-black hair and milk-white skin and a beauty to entrap and ruin a man's soul. But it was not for beauty's sake that Isolde was thankful, at times like this, if she was like Morgan, the daughter of Avalon. The grandmother who, for seven years now, had been to her nothing but a name in those same tales. </p><p> The guards had dropped their heads in greeting, but now the man who had stood by the coffin straightened and spoke. </p><p> "You are alone, lady?" </p><p> He was the elder of the two, forty or forty-five, his face hard, scarred with the marks of battle, his hands large and powerful. "You should not have come out without a guard." </p><p> A thin prickle rose on the back of Isolde's neck, but she said only, "I wish to keep vigil a time. I require no guard here." </p><p> She saw the two men exchange a quick sidelong glance, and then the first man said flatly, "You have a moment to say what prayers you will -- and then we will see you return safely to the women's hall. There is danger everywhere in such times as these." </p><p> Isolde stiffened, her brows lifting, and said, before she could stop herself, "Do you tell me so, indeed?" Then her gaze fell once more on the motionless figure beneath the dragon shield, and she drew a slow breath, willing herself to keep the flare of anger from her tone. </p><p> "May I know the names of those who keep such careful guard on my life?" </p><p> Again she saw the eyes of the two men slide sideways, the candlelight gleaming in the whites of their eyes. Then the elder said, "I am Hunno, lady, and this" -- his head jerked toward his companion -- "is Erbin." </p><p> "Very well, then, Hunno...Erbin." She looked from one man to the other. "I thank you -- both of you -- for your concern. But my lord husband and king has been dead but three days. And I would be alone with my sorrow. You are released from your duties here for the evening. You may go." </p><p> "Thank you, lady." Hunno's jaw was set, his voice still harsh. "But we have our orders from my lord Marche. We stay." </p><p> A chill ran through Isolde at the memory of what it had cost her to get away on her own, even for this brief time. And all for nothing, she thought, if I cannot force them to go. </p><p> "Orders?" she repeated. "My lord Marche may be king of Cornwall, but Tintagel is still the domain of the High King, as it has been since the Pendragon took the throne. It is not Marche who gives orders here." </p><p> "Is that so, lady?" A sly, ugly light appeared in Hunno's eyes. "Who is it who gives orders, then? As you say" -- he jerked his head backwards toward the coffin and the gleaming weapons of war -- "your husband King Constantine lies dead. Even a king's widow has small power on her own." </p><p> The second guard, a slight, dark youth with a thin, nervous face, stirred uneasily at Hunno's words and made to lay a restraining hand on his companion's arm, but Hunno shook him off with an impatient twist and took a step toward Isolde. </p><p> "Well, my lady?" </p><p> Isolde forced herself to stand without moving. "Have you forgotten, Hunno," she asked softly, "who I am?" </p><p> Hunno had started to take another step forward, but now he checked, and she saw a flicker of something that might have been fear stir at the back of his gaze. </p><p> Isolde's own eyes moved again to the still figure in the coffin, the hands lying limp against the folds of the crimson lining. Then she drew in her breath, looked up, and said, "Leave me. But before you go, return the ring you took from my husband's right hand." </p><p> She heard the younger man, Erbin, catch his breath in a sharp gasp, but Hunno didn't move. Fear pulled tight inside her, and she thought, as she always thought at such times, If, after all, I have guessed wrong... </p><p> There was time for her to count seven beats of her own heart while she forced herself to wait, hand extended, keeping her eyes on Hunno's. </p><p> And at last, with an angry mutter and a half-sullen, halffearful look from under his brows, Hunno drew something out of his belt and dropped it into Isolde's outstretched hand. </p><p> For a moment, his gaze locked with Isolde's, and then he turned to Erbin. "Come on, then." His voice was angry, his tone gruff. "There'll be ale yet a while in the fire hall." </p><p> Hunno swung round on his heel, but before following, Erbin took a step toward Isolde and said, in a stammering rush, "Forgive us, lady. We did not mean -- " </p><p> Isolde cut him off curtly, her hand tightening about the ring in her palm. "It's not for me to forgive. Make your peace with the king and go." She paused, looking again from one man to the other. Then she added, very quietly, "I will know if you disobey." <br> </p><p> Isolde waited until the sound of their booted footsteps died away, then she pressed her eyes briefly closed, feeling a prickle of perspiration on her back, despite the cold. Then, slowly, she turned once more to the open casket. Seven years now, she thought. Seven years that I have fought this battle. But now I am left to fight it entirely alone. </p><p> She let out a shaking breath. <i>The stars will still shine tomorrow, whatever happens to me here.</i> </p><p> She'd repeated the words so often over the years that they held the same familiar echo as one of the old tales. And now, as always when she thought or spoke them, a vague memory stirred in the shadows of her mind, of someone speaking them to give her courage as she'd done countless times since. </p><p> But that was part of a lifetime -- and a world -- that had died on the battlefield when Arthur fought her father, his traitor heir. Seven years ago. When she'd lost both Sight and memory of all that had gone before. </p><p> Isolde hadn't intended to move, but somehow she found herself at the edge of the coffin, looking down at the man who lay within and hearing the words she'd spoken seem to echo in the chapel's stillness. Alone with my sorrow, she thought. Alone with my sorrow, when I haven't even been able to cry for Con yet. </p><p> She had prepared the body for burial herself. Washed the blood and muck of the battlefield from his skin, anointed it with sweet oils. And seen in his side the blue-lipped, knife-thin wound where the dark heart's-blood had seeped out. But now, surrounded by the gleaming weapons, his head covered by the leather war helm, he seemed all at once frighteningly unreal. A figure from legend or song, remote as the great Arthur himself. </p><p> And yet, even now, Con's face looked scarcely older than that of the twelve-year-old boy he had been on the day of their crowning, his brow unlined beneath the wisps of straight, nut-brown hair, his skin smooth, with only a faint stubble of beard shadowing the rounded chin. Almost, she thought, he might be asleep. </p><p> Save for the folds of loosening flesh about the gold coins that covered his eyes. </p><p> A shudder twisted through her, and Isolde closed her own eyes, trying to summon up a memory of the living Constantine. The memory that came, though, was an older one. Not of the husband -- or even of the man. </p><p> They had met only once before they were wedded and crowned. Only once -- in the yard behind the stables ...</p></p><h2>Fever Pitch</h2><p>This is a book about identity, belonging, obsession; about afternoons in the driving rain and bitter cold and glorious, unforgettable goals; getting your head read in Hampstead and punched at Highbury; the dazzling skills of the gods of football and leaving your girlfriend lying fainted on the terraces because Arsenal are about to score. It&#39;s about the moments of ecstasy in one man&#39;s life. And his pain. And it&#39;s about the only true question there is: Which comes first, Football or Life?</p><p>In the States, Nick Hornby is best know as the author of <i>High Fidelity</i> and <i>About a Boy</i>, two wickedly funny novels about being thirtysomething and going nowhere fast. In Britain he is revered for his status as a fanatical football writer (sorry, fanatical soccer writer), owing to <i>Fever Pitch</i>--which is both an autobiography and a footballing Bible rolled into one. Hornby pinpoints 1968 as his formative year--the year he turned 11, the year his parents separated, and the year his father first took him to watch Arsenal play. The author quickly moved "way beyond fandom" into an extreme obsession that has dominated his life, loves, and relationships. His father had initially hoped that Saturday afternoon matches would draw the two closer together, but instead Hornby became completely besotted with the game at the expense of any conversation: "Football may have provided us with a new medium through which we could communicate, but that was not to say that we used it, or what we chose to say was necessarily positive." Girlfriends also played second fiddle to one ball and 11 men. He fantasizes that even if a girlfriend "went into labor at an impossible moment" he would not be able to help out until after the final whistle. <p> <i>Fever Pitch</i> is not a typical memoir--there are no chapters, just a series of match reports falling into three time frames (childhood, young adulthood, manhood). While watching the May 2, 1972, Reading v. Arsenal match, it became embarrassingly obvious to the then 15-year-old that his white, suburban, middle-class roots made him a wimp with no sense of identity: "Yorkshire men, Lancastrians, Scots, the Irish, blacks, the rich, the poor, even Americans and Australians have something they can sit in pubs and bars and weep about." But a boy from Maidenhead could only dream of coming from a place with "its own tube station and West Indian community and terrible, insoluble social problems." </p><p> <i>Fever Pitch</i> reveals the very special intricacies of British football, which readers new to the game will find astonishing, and which Hornby presents with remarkable humor and honesty--the "unique" chants sung at matches, the cold rain-soaked terraces, giant cans of warm beer, the trains known as football specials carrying fans to and from matches in prisonlike conditions, bottles smashing on the tracks, thousands of policemen waiting in anticipation for the cargo of hooligans. The sport and one team in particular have crept into every aspect of Hornby's life--making him see the world through Arsenal-tinted spectacles. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p>Nick Hornby is the author of six bestselling novels (High Fidelity, About a Boy, How To Be Good, A Long Way Down, Juliet, Naked and Funny Girl), as well as a novel for young adults, Slam, and four works of acclaimed non-fiction: Fever Pitch, 31 Songs, The Complete Polysyllabic Spree and Stuff I&#39;ve Been Reading.

Historian Susan Stryker charts the rise of the queer paperback within the context of American pop- and publishing culture, with a peppy and accessible overview of the cultural, political, economic, and sociological factors involved. A diverse lot, queer pulp is most easily broken down in the categories of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender themes. Within those subgenres, the books and authors themselves are accompanied by countless fascinating stories (for example, a former Georgetown University philosophy professor named H. Lynn Womack founded the notorious Guild Press, a major gay porn publishing house that was a prominent First Amendment crusader in the sixties). Featuring the work of such highbrow authors as W. Somerset Maugham and Truman Capote, to the no-brow hacks who worked under several names at once, Queer Pulp is the entertaining and informative introduction to these lost, lurid literary genres.</p><p>Susan Stryker, a freelance scholar, writer, and activist, earned her Ph.D. in US history at UC Berkeley, where she is currently a visiting professor in the Women&#39;s Studies Department. She has been on the Board of Directors of the Gay and Lesbian Historical Society of Northern California for the past two years where she has also worked as a volunteer and public program organizer. She has recently worked on the development of public policy on AIDS, the history of Frameline and the San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, post-structuralist theories of transsexuality, and the photography of Loren Cameron. She is the co-author of Gay by the Bay, a historical look at gay life in San Francisco, as well as Gay Pulp and Lesbian Pulp Address Books, all published by Chronicle Books.</p><h2>The Bumpy Little Pumpkin</h2><p>Little Nell chooses the bumpiest, littlest pumpkin in the patch to carve a jack-o'-lantern of her very own in this sweet Halloween companion to top-seller THE BIGGEST, BEST SNOWMAN.<br><br>All summer, Little Nell has tended the garden with BIG Mama, BIG Sarah, and BIG Lizzie, and finally the pumpkins are ready for Halloween. Her sisters choose smooth, round pumpkins to carve, but Little Nell likes a bumpy little one best. Sarah and Lizzie jeer, "It's bumpy and little and ugly!" But Little Nell perseveres. With help from her animal friends, she scoops and carves it into a wonderful jack-o'-lantern! This sweet tale shows that jack-o'-lanterns, like people, come in all shapes and sizes, and that BIG ideas and a BIG heart resound in even the smallest of us.<br></p><p>MARGERY CUYLER is the author of many children&#39;s books, including the first Little Nell story, The Biggest, Best Snowman; Please Say Please!: Penguin&#39;s Guide to Manners; and 100th Day Worries. She lives in Princeton, New Jersey.PreS-Gr. 2. Little Nell, who first appeared in <i>The Biggest, Best Snowman </i>(1998), is back in another story about an independent, young sibling. Nell is dwarfed by her sisters, BIG Lizzie and BIG Sarah, and by her mother, BIG Mama. At Halloween, Lizzie and Sarah choose huge, smooth pumpkins, while Nell selects the small, lumpy runt of the vine. Her sisters dismiss it as too "bumpy and little and ugly," and Nell withers under the criticism. Then her animal friends appear, and using antlers and beaks as tools, they help her carve a winning face on her pumpkin, earning Mama's praise and delight. Once again, Cuyler and Hillenbrand create a warm, empowering story about a youngest sister's struggles. Cuyler's infectious, repetitive text, with its recurrent use of <i>BIG,</i> is perfectly paced for participatory read-alouds, and Hillenbrand's cheery, whimsical mixed-media illustrations show Little Nell's perspective, moving from images of giant, looming figures to scenes with a more balanced scale at the story's triumphant end. A reassuring story about individuality, friendship, and finding beauty in the imperfect and unusual. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Please remember to fill out your reports and hand in your paperwork." Had the cheerful and musical voice belonged to a person who could be easily strangled, it would have stopped in mid-sentence.<br><br>Sadly, it was the melodious voice of the streetside window which interrupted the bustling and vastly less perky office in which the branch of Law known as the Hawks was based. That window, which had been installed complete with a magical, time-telling voice in some misguided attempt at humor, had been adjusted in the past couple of weeks by Acting Sergeant Mallory, and no one who had to work where they could hear it&#x2014;and were prevented by office regulations from destroying it&#x2014;considered the adjustments to be an improvement.<br><br>Sergeant Marcus Kassan, the large and currently bristling Leontine behind the central desk in the Hawks' Office raised his fist and flexed his fingers. Long claws, gleaming in the sun's light, appeared from beneath his golden fur. He had not yet shattered the window&#x2014;and given it was installed with the guidance of Imperial Mages, that would have been damn hard&#x2014;but he looked like he was on the edge of finally doing it in. The betting pool had not yet been won, but at least three people were out money, Private Kaylin Neya being one. The office had discovered, however, that the windows couldn't be scratched, and Kaylin had argued vociferously that this should have counted as a victory condition. She'd lost.<br><br>Then again, Leontines were generally all about the clawing, biting, rending, and ripping out of throats; they weren't as good with smashing things.<br><br>Kaylin's personal favorite was the new end-of-day message, wherein the cheerful voice of the window told the departing staff that they were to be in the office at 7:00 a.m., and they were to be shaved, where shaving was appropriate, and otherwise clean. She was less keen on the last bit, in which the Hawks were reminded to check the duty roster for last-minute adjustments.<br><br>"Why doesn't he just have the mages shut it down?" she asked Caitlin, as Marcus drove new furrows into his desk.<br><br>"I think he considers it a reminder of the differences between Sergeant Mallory's temporary tenure and his more permanent record," Caitlin replied. The reply, like the question that engendered it, was very, very quiet. This didn't guarantee that it couldn't be overheard, but unless Marcus had it in for you, he was capable of a bit of selective deafness. If he hadn't been, his office would be half manned for at least an entire duty cycle, and the half that was left alive would be too busy cleaning up to cause trouble.<br><br>"Neya!" Given Marcus's current mood, the fact that there had been no bloodshed was pushing the goodwill of whatever gods watched over underslept and underpaid police. "You're due out on beat in five minutes. Stop bothering Caitlin and hit the street."<br><br>Kaylin's beat was Elani Street and its surroundings, and her partner was&#x2014;as it so frequently was, these days&#x2014;Corporal Severn Handred. He was already kitted out and ready to go when she careened down the hall to the locker room. He raised an eyebrow, one bisected by a slender scar, while he watched her use the wall as a brake.<br><br>"What? I'm not late yet."<br><br>"Not yet. It's hard to be late when the window is nagging."<br><br>She grimaced. "Marcus took his claws to it yesterday."<br><br>"Don't start."<br><br>"I think that should count."<br><br>"Is the window still in one piece? Then it doesn't count." Severn was at the top of the betting pool at the moment, and looked to be secure in his position, but they'd both grown up on some pretty mean streets, and "secure" meant something different to them.<br><br>This was probably why they got along so well with the Barrani Hawks. The Barrani were noted for their love of the political. Political, in the context of their race, usually involved assassination, both literally and figuratively, and smallish wars. They understood that anything they owned had to be held against all comers. Those who held less were perfectly willing to test the definition of "secure," often to the breaking point.<br><br>Of course, unless one of those assassination attempts was lucky, the Barrani weren't about to expire of old age; they didn't. Age, that is. They had long memories, and they could easily hold a grudge for longer than Kaylin's whole life; at least two of them did. On the other hand, they made immortality look like one long gripe fest, admittedly with killer clothing, so it was hard to begrudge them their eternity of suffering. Or of making everyone else they knew suffer. Kaylin, as a human, would eventually clock out, which would in theory earn her some peace.<br><br>She dressed quickly, straightening out the cloth and under-padding that had managed to crumple in the wrong places the way it always did, and then rearranged her hair so it was pulled tight and off her face. It wasn't immortality that she envied the Barrani; it was their damn hair. It never got in the way of anything.<br><br>She made it out of the locker room with seconds to spare; Severn caught her by the shoulder and adjusted the stick that held her hair tightly in place so that it actually did the job.<br><br>Elani Street was, of course, Charlatan Central. It was also, unfortunately, where real magic could be found if you didn't have access to the Imperial Mages, or worse, the mages of the Arcanum, which access pretty much described ninety-nine percent of the city of Elantra. Kaylin had never understood how it was that people capable of genuine enchantments were willing to hunker down with total frauds.<br><br>The end result, however, of some fraud was ire, and the end result of ire, if not checked, was directly the purview of the Hawks. It was more colloquially called murder. It didn't happen in Elani often, because even if you were <em>almost </em>certain the so-called magic you'd purchased was a lump of rock, you couldn't be as easily certain that the person who'd sold it to you was incapable of something more substantial.<br><br>There were, however, no murders on the books today. Or at least not murders that Kaylin knew about, and therefore not murders that she would be called in to investigate. She'd wanted a few weeks of quiet, and she'd had them. For some reason, it hadn't improved her mood.<br><br>Severn noticed. Then again, it was hard not to notice. While he frequently walked streetside, Kaylin's accidental mishaps with merchant boards now numbered four.<br><br>"Kaylin." He stepped to her left, and took up patrol position merchant-side.<br><br>She couldn't bring herself to say it was accidental, although she did try. But the boards that promised to find you your One True Love were a particular sore spot for Kaylin, in part because it was impossible to walk past the damn things at <em>any </em>time of day, and not see people waiting in the storefront, behind glass. Some had the brains to look ill-at-ease, but if they had the brains, they clearly lacked self-control; some just looked desperate and flaky.<br><br>All of them would be disappointed.<br><br>"You know they piss me off," she muttered.<br><br>"On the wrong day, sunlight pisses you off."<br><br>"Only in the morning."<br><br>"Noon is not considered morning by most people. Tell me," he added. "Because if you keep this up, Margot is going to file an incident report, and you'll be in the hot seat."<br><br>Margot was the name of the proprietor of this particular haven for the hopeless. She was a tall, statuesque redhead, with amber eyes that Kaylin would have bet an entire paycheck were magically augmented. Her voice,<br><br>absent the <em>actual </em>drivel she used when speaking, was throaty, deep, and almost sinful just to <em>hear.</em><br><br>Kaylin was certain that half of the people who offered Margot their custom secretly hoped that she would be their One True Love. Sadly, she was certain that Margot was also aware of this, and they'd exchanged heated words about the subject of her lovelorn customers in the past. Petty jealousy being what it was, however, Kaylin was liked by enough of the <em>other </em>merchants, mostly the less successful ones, that Margot's attempt to have her summarily scheduled out of existence&#x2014;or the existence of Elani Street&#x2014;had so far failed to take.<br><br>"If I knew what was bothering me," she finally admitted, "I would have warned you this morning."<br><br>"Warned me?"<br><br>"That I'm in a foul mood."<br><br>"Kaylin, the only person who might not notice that is Roshan, Marrin's newest orphan. And I have my doubts."<br><br>"I have no idea what's wrong," she continued, steadfastly ignoring that particular comment. "The foundling hall is running so smoothly right now you'd think someone rich had died and willed the foundlings all their money. Rennick's play was a success, and the Swords have been cut to a tenth their previous riot-watch numbers. I'm not on report. Mallory is no longer our <em>acting </em>sergeant. Caitlin is finally back in the office after her leave.<br><br>"But&#x2014;" she exhaled heavily "&#x2014;there's just...something. I have no idea what the problem <em>is. </em>And if you <em>even suggest </em>that it has something to do with the time of month, you'll be picking up splinters of your teeth well into next year."<br><br>He touched her, gently and briefly, on the shoulder. "You'll let me know when you figure it out?"<br><br>"You'll probably be the first person to know. Unless Marcus radically alters the duty roster."<br><br>The day did not get better when their patrol took them to Evanton's shop. Kaylin didn't stop there when she was on duty, because rifling his kitchen took time, and sitting and drinking the scalding hot tea he prepared when she did visit took more of the same.<br><br>Like most merchants, Evanton's shop had a sandwich board outside. The paint was faded, the wood slightly warped. His sign, however, did not offend her; she barely noticed it. She certainly didn't trip over it in a way that would snap its hinges shut.<br><br>But she did notice the young man who came barreling out of the door toward her. Grethan. Once Tha'alani. Hell, still Tha'alani. But crippled, shut off from the gifts that made the Tha'alani possibly the most feared race in the city. He couldn't read minds. The characteristic racial stalks of the Tha'alani, suspended at the height of his forehead, just beneath his dark, flat hair, still weaved frantically in the air in a little I'm-upset-help-me dance, and most people&#x2014;most humans, she corrected herself&#x2014; wouldn't know he was incapable of actually putting them to use to invade their thoughts.<br><br>"Kaylin!" he said, speaking too loudly in a street that was sparsely populated.<br><br>The people that were in it looked up immediately. You could always count on curiosity to dim common sense, <em>especially </em>in Elani Street. Evanton was known to be one of the street's genuine enchanters; he would have to be, given that he was also one of the few who still had a storefront and never offered love-potions or fortunes. Had he visible size or obvious power, he would probably have terrified most of the residents. He didn't.<br><br>She spoke in a much lower voice. It was her way of giving a subtle hint; the less subtle hints usually got her a reprimand, and Grethan looked wide-eyed and wild enough that she didn't think he deserved them. Yet. "Gre-than? Has something happened to Evanton?"<br><br>He took a deep breath. "No. He told me you'd be coming, and he set me to watch."<br><br>Had it been anyone other than Evanton, Kaylin would have asked how he'd known. Evanton, however, was not a man who casually explained little details like that to an apprentice, and if Grethan was valued because he was Evanton's first promising apprentice in more years than Kaylin had been alive, he was still on the lower rungs of the ladder.<br><br>He was also, she thought, too damn smart to ask. "You're not busy, are you?" Grethan asked, hesitating at the door.<br><br>"Not too busy to speak with Evanton if he has something he needs to say," she replied.<br><br>Severn, damn him, added, "She's busy plotting the downfall of Margot."<br><br>Grethan snorted. "You're probably going to have to stand in line for that," he told her, his stalks slowing their frantic dance. "But Evanton's in a bit of a mood today, so you might not want to mention her by name."<br><br>"I never want to mention her by name. You'll note that it wasn't me who did," she replied, giving Severn a very distinct look.<br><br>"Evanton is also not the only one who's in, as you put it, a bit of a mood," Severn told Grethan. "Maybe the two of us should wait outside somewhere safe. Like, say, the docks."<br><br></p><h2>Uwe Ommer.

The key to his phenomenal success is his ability to help participants take back control of the power food holds over them, and to help set goals based on what &#34;shaping up&#34; means to each of us.Jonny Bowden&#39;s Shape Up! is like no other &#34;diet&#34; program: it takes into account personal factors such as commitment, self-esteem, body image, impulse control, and addictions, as well as issues like metabolic type, genetics, ethnic heritage, and hormones, and shows readers how to tailor consistent low-sugar, low-carbohydrate nutrition to fit individual needs. With humor and a down-to-earth style, Bowden presents realistic and simple week-by-week eating plans-as well as recommendations on vitamins, minerals, and food supplements-and the tools to customize the program for long-term success. He shows readers how to analyze food&#39;s effects on moods, cravings, and energy levels, and also demonstrates the how and why of light workout routines. A wise and empowering program, Jonny Bowden&#39;s Shape Up! will help readers everywhere take charge of their lives and make changes that will dramatically improve their health, weight, and state of mind.</p><p>"People don't like being told what to do," says nutritionist and personal trainer Jonny Bowden. And that's the fundamental problem with weight loss programs: they are someone else's idea of what's good for you, which translates, in your mind, to deprivation and self-denial. "People don't fail when they design their own lives according to what they want to do." So Bowden helps you design an eating program for yourself that is personalized for your measurements, temperament, lifestyle, and metabolic and biochemical uniqueness.<p> Bowden offers his "A" food list (eat more of these), including vegetables, fish, eggs, lean meat, and "good" fats. His "B" list (reduce your intake of these) includes commercial breads, pastas, and cereals; refined oils; margarine; and sugar (including fruit juices). He advises you to control starches (including grains)--maybe one portion a day. He's "cautious" about recommending soy. He says supplements are essential.</p><p> Bowden uses much of his book to explain why, in his view, the dietary recommendations of major medical organizations are "ridiculous." He admits that he is taking on "the medical and nutritional establishment" with some of his recommendations. He disputes the Food Pyramid (accepted by all the major medical and dietetic organizations) and pronounces Dean Ornish's low-fat dietary recommendations "from the dark ages"--even though Ornish's program has been shown in published, peer-reviewed studies to reverse heart disease. He calls the carbohydrate recommendations from the "American Dietary Association" (he must mean the American Dietetic Association) "nuts."</p><p> Bowden's beginner's exercise program consists of walking and strength training. Although he hates "one size fits all" diets, he doesn't seem to mind this approach for exercise, because he tells you exactly what to do each day for eight weeks, including how many minutes to walk. The strength training is appropriate, well explained, and well illustrated. The only cardiovascular exercise is walking, and he doesn't discuss other alternatives until the appendix, and only if you're at the "advanced beginner" level or higher.</p><p> Bowden is a personal trainer and nutritionist (note: not the same thing as a registered dietician).

But this soldier might be better dead than face his latest assignment.</p><p>Ogre Company is the legion's dumping ground--a motley, undisciplined group of monsters whose leaders tend to die under somewhat questionable circumstances. That's where Ned's rather unique talents come in. As Ogre Company's newly appointed commander, Ned finds himself in charge of such fine examples of military prowess as a moonstruck Amazon, a very big (and very polite) two-headed ogre, a seductively scaly siren, a blind oracle who can hear (and smell) the future, a suicidal goblin daredevil pilot, a walking tree with a chip on its shoulder, and a suspiciously goblinesque orc.<br>Ned has only six months to whip the Ogre Company into shape or face an even more hideous assignment, but that's not the worst of his problems. Because now that Ned has found out <i>why</i> he keeps returning from dead, he has to do everything he can to stay alive. . . .</p><p><i>In the Company of Ogres</i> does for fantasy, what A. Lee Martinez's previous novel, <i>Gil's All Fright Diner</i>, did for horror--and elves and goblins may never be the same!</p></p><p><p><b>A. Lee Martinez</b> lives in Terrell, Texas.</p>Chapter One<br>His name was Never Dead Ned, but it was only a nickname. He could die. He'd met his death forty-nine times, and forty-nine times he'd risen from the grave. Although, after his reputation spread, people stopped bothering to bury him. They'd just throw his corpse in a corner and wait for him to rise again. And he always did. But every death took a little bit away from him, put another ache in his joints, sapped a little more spring from his step. And Ned learned the hard way that there were worse things than dying.<br>&nbsp;<br>There was dying over and over again.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ned didn't have much interest in living, but he did his damnedest to avoid perishing again. Not until he could do it right. Not until he knew with absolute certainty that he would stay dead. For a soldier, fearing death was usually a career ender, but Ned found a position in the bookkeeping department of Brute's Legion. It wasn't much. Just counting coins. It didn't pay well, but it was relatively safe. As safe as it ever was when your supervisor had a strict policy of devouring anyone whose books were out of balance more than three times a month.<br>&nbsp;<br>War was the Legion's business, and business had been good until four hundred years earlier, when the various species of the world had finally managed to put aside their differences. The Legion's accountants had predicted a swift and irreversible downward spiral in profits. And sure enough, the following three decades had been rough. But what everyone should've known was that paranoia doesn't vanish with peace. Soon every kingdom, every country, every hamlet with two pieces of gold to rub together suddenly needed a military force. For protection, of course, and to deter the benevolent military forces of their neighbors from getting any ideas. Never mind that most had gotten along just fine without an army before. Never mind that most didn't have anything worth taking. The Legion was only too happy to lease its armies to the world. War had been good for business. But peace was far more lucrative.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gryphons never stopped growing, and Tate, well over three hundred years old, was a giant beast. His impressive black wings spanned twenty feet when spread, but he didn't spread them often in the confines of his office, a literal nest of ledgers dating back to the very beginnings of the Legion. Back when it had been a handful of orcs, a few dozen mercenaries, and a pair of dragons with a vision. Back before it'd become the most successful freelance army on three continents.<br>&nbsp;<br>Tate spoke. He rarely looked at who he was speaking to. This was a blessing, since his cold, black eyes focused with an unblinking, predatory stare. They always made Ned worry about becoming lunch, even when his books were perfect. He wasn't interested in coming back from the dead after a trip through anyone's digestive system.<br>&nbsp;<br>Tate glanced through the ledger slowly, methodically. He turned the delicate pages with his long, black claws. He missed nothing, not the slightest detail. Especially since he was always hungry. His sharp beak bent in a frown. His great black wings flapped once.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Very good, Ned. Impeccable as always."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Thank you, sir." Ned adjusted his spectacles. He didn't need them. In fact, they blurred his vision, but they made him look bookish, which was a look he very much wanted to cultivate.<br>&nbsp;<br>Tate handed back the ledger. He swept the chamber with his gaze, never quite settling his eyes on Ned. "For a soldier, you make an extraordinary bookkeeper."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Thank you, sir." Ned adjusted his spectacles again in an effort to look even more bookish, but his flesh wore the reminders of forty-nine grisly ends. The scars crossing his arms and face, particularly the long, nasty one across his right cheek down to a red slash around his throat, made a far greater impression than his eyeglasses. And of course, there was his missing eye, his cauliflower ear, and his bad arm. All the marks of a man who should've been dead long ago. For a bookkeeper, he'd made a barely adequate soldier.<br>&nbsp;<br>The gryphon cleared his throat, and Ned took this as his dismissal. When he turned to leave, Tate spoke again.<br>&nbsp;<br>"When you were first assigned to me, I assumed you would be my dinner within the week." He ran a black tongue across his beak. "Instead, you've become one of the most trusted members of my staff."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Thank you, sir."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Pity I have to lose you."<br>&nbsp;<br>Ned, taken aback, stared into those merciless eyes. Tate's gray and black feathers ruffled, and he sneered.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I've just gotten the news today. You're being transferred."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Transferred, sir?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Tate nodded very slowly. He smoothed his feathers back with a talon. "I tried to talk them out of it, but this comes straight from the top. Upper, upper, upper management." He rummaged through his nest of paperwork and pulled out a blue scroll.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ned swore under his breath. Blue scrolls were irreversible, unstoppable. As inevitable as death or, in Ned's case, even more inevitable than death. Tate handed over the blue scroll, but Ned refused to unroll it and take a look at his new orders just yet.<br>&nbsp;<br>Tate cocked his head to one side, then another. His lion's tail swished lazily. He cleared his throat again, and again. Before Ned could leave, the gryphon spoke up.<br>&nbsp;<br>"It's a promotion. You've earned it."<br>&nbsp;<br>Ned snapped his teeth together softly, as he often did when irritated. "Thank you, sir."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Congratulations. Upper management must have a great deal of faith in you."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Thank you, sir."<br>&nbsp;<br>He held the blue scroll tightly in his right hand, while his bad left arm tried to pry it free. In one of his more unpleasant demises, the left limb had been severed. The arm had come back to life without him, and though a medic had stitched it back on, it still had a mind of its own, with obnoxious tendencies in tense situations. Given a chance, he knew the bad arm would throw the scroll at Tate. That might get Ned eaten, and he had enough worries already.<br>&nbsp;<br>He turned to leave once more. Tate cleared his throat, and Ned stopped.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Sir?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"You're dismissed. Send in Yip. Very sloppy work lately. I suspect disciplinary action is in order." Tate clicked his beak with a grin. "And tell him to stop by the commissary and bring up some bread, cheese, a bottle of wine, and a dinner salad. Something zesty, but not too filling."<br>&nbsp;<br>Ned walked from the office, feeling very much like a condemned man. A blue scroll was supposed to be a good thing. It meant upper management had taken special notice of him. But it was like being noticed by the gods in the heavens. More often than not, it was a one-way ticket to a tragic fate. Up to now, he'd done a fine job of being unexceptional. Except for not staying dead, but that wasn't his doing.<br>&nbsp;<br>His fellow bookkeepers avoided looking at him as he walked through the halls. And everyone averted their eyes from the blue scroll clutched in his hand. Rumor had it that blue scrolls were enchanted to strike all but their intended reader blind. This was mere conjecture, since almost no one had actually ever seen a blue scroll. But no one was willing to take the chance of looking directly at it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ned returned to his office, a small chamber he shared with two others: Yip, a ratling, and Bog, the slime mold. Yip was counting a stack of gold coins. He'd shove one in his pocket once in a while. Ned and Bog always pretended not to notice. Neither liked the ratling, and they weren't about to discourage anything that might get him eaten. Bog was busy weighing bars of silver. Yip glanced up from his work just long enough to grin and chuckle.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Tough luck, Ned."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Have you read it yet?" asked Bog.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ned shook his head.<br>&nbsp;<br>"It could be good news," offered the slime mold.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Betcha it's a transfer to the wyrm farm." Yip clinked two coins together. "Up to your neck in dirt and manure all day. And those wyrms stink. Oh, boy, do they stink."<br>&nbsp;<br>Ned sat, laid his head on his desk, put his arms over his head. His bad arm yanked at his hair.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Glad I'm not you," said Yip.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Tate wants to see you." Ned didn't have the energy to raise his eye to glimpse Yip's face, but he heard the ratling swallow hard. That made Ned feel a little better.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bog's eyes bobbed in his transparent flesh, floating to look at Ned from slightly different angles. "You should read it before you start panicking."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I'm not panicking."<br>&nbsp;<br>"He's moping," said Yip.<br>&nbsp;<br>"It's probably not as bad as you're imagining," replied Bog.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Probably worse." Ned held the blue scroll down on his desk as if it might jump up and attack him. "I don't have a very good imagination."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Give it to me." Yip bounded from his desk and snatched the scroll. Ned held fast, and they commenced a brief tug-of-war.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Just give me the damn thing already!" The ratling snapped at Ned's hand, and he let go.<br>&nbsp;<br>"You'll be struck deaf," said Bog.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Blind," corrected Ned.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bog adjusted his eyes with his tentacles. "I suppose that makes more sense."<br>&nbsp;<br>With the same fearless stupidity that was soon to make him a gryphon's dinner, Yip unfurled the ominous document. Both Ned and Bog lowered their heads (or head-like protrusion in the slime mold's case), expecting something terrible. But there was no flash of lightning, no torrent of shrieking phantoms, no unholy blackness to fall upon the office. Not even a single cackling imp or cold snap.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Well?" asked Bog. "Are you blind?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Yip rolled up the scroll and set it back on the desk. "Sorry, Ned."<br>&nbsp;<br>Ned opened the scroll. "They've given me a command."<br>&nbsp;<br>"That's not so bad," said Bog with feigned enthusiasm.<br>&nbsp;<br>"It's Ogre Company."<br>&nbsp;<br>Quiet descended, a silence so consuming that even the drafty corridors ceased whistling. Bog wasn't certain where to look, so he solved the problem by plucking out his eyes and sticking them in a drawer.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Tough luck, Ned." Yip strolled from the office with a frown, stopping in the door on his way to the belly of a monster. "Glad I'm not you."<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2006 by A.

(with) great wit, insight, and in-your-face energy.&#34;--Review of Contemporary Fiction.</p><p>Based primarily on the authors' experiences hanging out with the owners of a small rap music production company, the first part of this long essay on understanding rap describes the setting in which this subversive music has arisen--the urban ghetto, in this case, the North Dorchester section of Boston. We get a vivid picture of rap's real-life context in an area of poverty, drugs and various types of radical activity, an environment closed to upscale whites by the barriers of fear and oppression. The music similarly remains for whites, assert the authors, "like little more than looking at something venomous in a tightly closed jar." Much of the book is devoted to a critical explication and validation of rap, including literary and historical analysis, placing it, for instance, in the context of African oral tradition. But away from the stark truths of reportage, the authors--Costello is an assistant district attorney in Manhattan; Wallace wrote the novel The Broom of the System --often get mired in theoretical hyperbole and digression. They claim to be the first whites to appreciate its political radicalness and artistic value, calling rap "quite possibly the most important stuff happening in American poetry today." <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Apt. 3 (Picture Books)</h2><p>On a rainy day two brothers try to discover who is playing the harmonica they hear in their apartment building</p><p>Ezra Jack Keats (1916 1983) is the Caldecott Medal winning author of&nbsp;The Snowy Day, which broke ground in 1962 as one of the first picture books for young children to portray a realistic, multi-cultural urban setting.

Guided by Agnes Whistling Elk into a world of power and magic, Lynn Andrews enters the sacred Dreamtime and emerges as a young woman, Catherine, in medieval England. There she encounters Grandmother, the Woman of Wyrrd, who becomes her teacher -- a woman who offers to take Andrews's ordinary life and build it into a remarkable one full of power, goodness, adventure, and love. In this dazzling spritual adventure, Andrews tells the fascinating story of Catherine's introduction into the secrets of the Sisterhood, her initiation into its rituals and cermonies, her confrontation with death when she dishonors that tradititon, and her terrifying attemp to recover the soul she loses to a dark brooding man who enters her life. In <i>The Woman of Wyrrd,</i> Lynn Andrews reveals the many secrets she has learned about working with the energies of Mother Earth, restoring feminine power and potential, and ultimately tapping into a life without fear.</p></p><p>Lynn V. Andrews has chronicled her path of self-discovery and her explorations into feminine spirituality in nine books in the "Medicine Woman" series, which include <i>Jaguar Woman, The Woman of Wyrrd,</i> and <i>Shakkai.</i> She is also the author of <i>The Power Deck,</i> a series of self-affirming meditational cards, and <i>Teachings Around the Sacred Wheel,</i> a workbook. Andrews leads seminars across the country and offers an annual intensive retreat. She lives in Los Angeles, California.This glacially paced account of the author's regression to a previous medieval lifetime in which she learns ancient mysteries follows Medicine Woman and other reports of Andrews's past lives. Guided by two Indian shaman women, Agnes Whistling Elk and Ruby Plenty Chiefs, the narrator takes up, in "Dreamtime," the life of a young English noblewoman, Catherine, as she is taught by a crone she calls Grandmother about the women of the Wyrrd, who long predate Western culture and worship the "firstness of women." Catherine/Andrews learns mental skills such as healing, movement out of the body and communication with animals. She also meets a young nobleman who refuses her love to retain his position in his current lifetime, leaving the narrator to find her own salvation. Reading like historical romance, this will be snapped up by Andrews's large following. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Digital Black &amp; White Photography (Expanded Guides - Techniques)</h2><p><p><b>Expert advice on how to shoot black and white images on today's sophisticated digital SLR and compact digital cameras and even on mobile phones</b></p> <p>Aimed at both the novice and more experienced amateur photographer, jargon-free text explains the theory behind digital photography, along with a guide to the equipment and software needed to take outstanding images.

Through the dramatic and moving letters and testimony of freed slaves, the documents in <i>Families and Freedom</i> provide deep insight into the most intimate aspects of the transformation of slaves to free people. This book is the sequel to the 1994 Lincoln Prize winner <i>Free at Last</i>, which was described in the <i>New York Times</i> as "this generation's most significant encounter with the American past."<br></p><p><b>Ira Berlin</b> and <b>Leslie S. Rowland</b>, editors of <i>Free at Last</i> (The New Press), teach history at the University of Maryland. They are former and present directors, respectively, of the Freedmen and Southern Society Project, which is compiling a multivolume documentary history of the transition from slavery to freedom.<br>Berlin and Rowland, editors of the prize-winning collection Free at Last, have come up with another moving documentary history, this one focusing on black family life in the Civil War era. Told mostly from the perspectives of black soldiers and their families, these poignant letters show the devotion and love that existed among African-American relatives despite all efforts to destroy slave families. Slaves were usually discouraged by their masters from forming familial relationships--they were split up regularly when relatives were sold; there was no official recognition of slave marriages--yet many slaves managed to nurture close families. During the Civil War, these relationships were sorely tested, as families were again separated, women and children left, even after liberation, among their embittered former owners. Yet it is hard to say who was more destructive of the black family during the war--the North or the South. The federal government was shameful in its treatment of black soldiers fighting for the Union: Letters here attest to the fact that they were often forcefully conscripted and received less than half the pay of their white counterparts. Their families receieved little or none of the promised assistance, and the soldiers were denied furlough or required to pay dearly for it, even when the war was over. As one ``umble soldier'' who could not get leave wrote to the secretary of war to beg permission to visit his family: ``In August I lost two of my children. I asked for a leaf [sic] of absence and was refused. . . . Now the war is over and I now want to see those who are dearer to me than my life.'' A revealing history about the precarious state of black families during and after the Civil War. (36 b&amp;w illustrations) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He has claimed as his turf our soul history, the germinal material, vast and brooding, that is always left out of more orthodox (all of them) books about America" (Jim Harrison, on<i>Blood Orchid</i>). In this seminal book, Bowden turns his fearless gaze toward the future, the future we can feel hurtling toward us as fuel reserves dwindle, species die out, terrorism flourishes, the Earth warms, and our ability to be fully awake - alert and impassioned in our lives - wanes. Weaving together natural history, memoir, reportage, and sheer virtuosic writing, he takes us on a furious tour of our emerging reality, his observations from the borderlands - of nations, laws, species, and desire - allthe more searing for his refusal to be our scourge. Bowden has always had the gift of prophecy, but<i>Some of the Dead Are Still Breathing</i>is proof that the times have caught up with his vision. We need that vision now more than ever.

Large numbers of children are stranded in orphanages, and systems we take for granted are fraying at the seams. When orphaned Cole Vining finds refuge with an evangelical pastor and his young wife in a small Indiana town, he knows he is one of the lucky ones. Sheltered Salvation City has been spared much of the devastation of the outside world. <br><br> But it's a starkly different community from the one Cole has known, and he struggles with what this changed world means for him. As those around him become increasingly fixated on their vision of utopia - so different from his own parents' dreams - Cole begins to imagine a new and different future for himself. <br><br> Written in Sigrid Nunez's deceptively simple style, <i>Salvation City</i> is a story of love, betrayal, and forgiveness, weaving the deeply affecting story of a young boy's transformation with a profound meditation on the true meaning of salvation.</p><p>Sigrid Nunez is the author of the novels <i>The Last of Her Kind</i>, <i>A Feather on the Breath of God</i>, and <i>For Rouenna</i>, among others. She has been the recipient of several awards including a Whiting Writers' Award, the Rome Prize in Literature, and a Berlin Prize Fellowship. She lives in New York City.<b>Part One</b><p>The best way to remember people after they've passed is to remember the good about them.</p><p>The first time Cole hears Pastor Wyatt say this he remembers how his mother hated when people said passed, or passed away. He'd come home from school one day and repeated the teacher's announcement: Ruthie Lind was absent that day because her grandmother had passed.</p><p>"Died. Say died, pumpkin," his mother said. "Passed sounds so silly."</p><p>She had called him pumpkin and she did not seem to be angry with him, but he had felt obscurely ashamed. Later he was told that people were afraid to say died because they were afraid of dying. Passed was just a euphemism. The funny-sounding word was new to Cole and for a time it kept recurring, floating into his head for no apparent reason. But the first time he saw the word in a book he did not recognize it, he was so sure it began with a <i>u</i>. Followed by an <i>f</i>, of course.</p><p>Pastor Wyatt does not always say passed. More often he says went home. ("Had a great-aunt went home at a hundred and three.") It all depends on whether the person he is talking about was saved or unsaved.</p><p>When he is preaching, Pastor Wyatt never says passed.</p><p>Pastor Wyatt is not afraid of dying.</p><p>"That's my job in a nutshell. I've got to teach people not to be afraid. We're all going to die, that's for certain. And the thing for folks to do is stop wasting their energy being all headless and fearful like a herd of spooked cattle."</p><p>At first, whenever Pastor Wyatt spoke directly to him, Cole would watch Pastor Wyatt's hands. He was not yet comfortable looking Pastor Wyatt in the face. Cole was keeping so much in&#x2014;he had so many secrets&#x2014;he did not like to look anyone in the face if he could help it. He knew this gave the impression he'd done something wrong, and that is just how he felt: as if he'd done something wrong and was trying to hide it.</p><p>He still feels this way much of the time. He thinks he will always feel this way.</p><p>Pastor Wyatt himself has a way of looking at people that Cole would call staring. His mother would have called it fucking rude. But from what he can tell, other people are not at all disturbed by the way Pastor Wyatt looks&#x2014;or stares&#x2014;at them.</p><p>Cole understands that Pastor Wyatt is thought to be handsome, though Cole himself has no opinion about this. But he has observed that people are delighted to have Pastor Wyatt's attention on them, especially if they are women. Pastor Wyatt always looks right into the face of the person he is talking to, and his eyes are almost like hands that reach out and hold you so you can't turn away. Somewhere Cole has read about a person giving someone else a <i>searching</i> look. He thinks this is a good description of what Pastor Wyatt does, too. But with Pastor Wyatt it's not something that happens once, or once in a while, but more like every time, and in the beginning Cole hated it.</p><p>He has never known anyone who looks so hard at other people. (He's got Holy Spirit high beams, members of the congregation like to say.) Cole has never known anyone who smiles so much, either. He smiles even when he preaches and when he is preaching about bad things, like temptation and sin. He smiles so that people won't be afraid. He is a tall man with a wide neck and naturally padded shoulders, and around shorter people he tends to slouch, bending his knees if need be&#x2014;he does not like the feeling of towering over anyone. (Cole always thinks of this when Pastor Wyatt tells him to stand up straight, or not to hunch at the table.) When he is among children, Pastor Wyatt will sometimes do a full knee bend, balancing on the balls of his feet. It would break his heart to know that any child was afraid of him.</p><p>Pastor Wyatt still shakes hands with people. He pays no attention to the warning to switch to the elbow bump. Cole remembers learning about this while he was still in regular school. Public health officials were trying to get people to switch because touching elbows did not spread infection the way touching hands did. Cole knows there are many people who have switched, but he sees the elbow bump only when he is around strangers. The people he sees every day make fun of the elbow bump. They shake hands and they hug one another, even though Pastor Wyatt says the disease that spared them all this time around is neither the last nor the worst of its kind. Other plagues are coming, he says, smiling. And he thinks they will be here soon.</p><p>Pastor Wyatt's hands are of a whiteness and a softness that make Cole think of milk, of goose down, of freshly washed and bleached flannel sheets. It is impossible to imagine flu germs, or germs of any kind, lurking on such clean hands. Pastor Wyatt has never been sick a day in his life. If anyone else made such a claim, Cole would surely doubt it. But if Pastor Wyatt says it, he thinks it must be true.</p><p>Most marvelous are the fingernails, each tipped with a perfect little white crescent moon. He knows these nails are the work of Tracy, Pastor Wyatt's wife. He has caught her giving Pastor Wyatt manicures. Not that they try to hide it. They do the manicures right at the kitchen table, usually while listening to the radio. There is a television in the house, but Pastor Wyatt disapproves of television&#x2014;the idiot box, he calls it&#x2014;and Cole isn't allowed to watch much. But the radio is often on, playing Christian twang (Tracy's thing; Cole and Pastor Wyatt prefer Christian rock), or tuned to some talk show or sermon. Pastor Wyatt himself is a regular guest on the local station, on a weekly program called <i>Heaven's A-Poppin'!</i></p><p>When he sees Tracy doing Pastor Wyatt's nails, Cole is embarrassed, almost as if he'd caught them having sex. He has no idea if Pastor Wyatt and Tracy have sex; he chooses to think they do not. He is a hundred percent certain he will never catch them having sex. He will never see either of them naked. It simply must not be allowed to happen. If it happens, he will have to die.</p><p>He thinks of the time he saw his parents lying naked on top of their covers, in broad daylight&#x2014;the shades were up, sun fell across the bed&#x2014;and how it was one of the worst moments of his life. He would have given all his toys to undo it.</p><p>First his parents pretended it never happened. Then something&#x2014;most likely his behavior&#x2014;must have changed their minds, and they insisted on talking about it. Which Cole would not do. Worst of all was when they tried teasing him about it. He would have given all his toys a second time for them just to forget it. Secretly he had vowed that no one would ever see him naked.</p><p>About sex he knew then just enough to feel shame. Certain photos he'd seen&#x2014;ripped from magazines and passed around at school&#x2014;had left him with images of unhealthy-looking grayish-pink flesh, like meat that had turned, and hideous tufts of dark hair where hair shouldn't even be, images that soured his stomach. It would have taken a miracle to connect them with the time he stumbled on Jade Korsky during a game of hide-and-seek. In the dark closet their teeth had clicked together like magnets, and they had tongued her cherry cough drop back and forth till it was the size of a lentil.</p><p>The moment he heard what intercourse was, instinct told him it was true. The knowledge had brought an anxious and bewildering sorrow, a feeling that would return when he learned what his mother's box of tampons was for. He did not share the excitement about these matters other boys couldn't hide. From what he could tell, his responses weren't normal, and he would not dream of revealing them.</p><p>Sometime&#x2014;he cannot say exactly how long, maybe a year&#x2014;sometime after he'd walked in on his parents lying naked, he walked in on them fighting and heard his mother say, "We never fuck anymore anyway, what the fuck do you care?" When they saw him they tried to explain, but only halfheartedly. And it was this half-heartedness that had enraged him, moving him to perhaps his first real effort at sarcasm. "Sure. I know. You guys were just rehearsing for a play."</p><p>No one had tried to stop him as he turned on his heel. He remembers his cold satisfaction, leaving them speechless behind him. He remembers thinking, <i>Now they'll know how much I've grown up</i>.</p><p>But he is not sure anymore if in fact it was his mother he heard that day. Maybe it was his father. This has become a familiar problem. Cole gets mixed up. He is never completely sure of anything he remembers anymore. He was told that after his fever broke he did not even remember his own name. It wasn't exactly amnesia, but the illness had damaged his brain. He was not the only one to whom this had happened. It happened to many other people as well. It happened to the president of the United States.</p><p>Even now there are important things Cole knows he should remember that he cannot remember at all. He has resigned himself to perhaps never remembering them again. He knows he is lucky to know his name, lucky not to have worse damage, lucky to be alive. Though he wishes ardently to learn not to be afraid to die, he cannot help being glad&#x2014;even if it sometimes makes him feel base&#x2014;that he survived.</p><p>It was his mother, he decides. Both his parents used swear words all the time, but it was more like his mother to swear twice in one sentence.</p><p>Pastor Wyatt uses a cream that makes his hands smell like cookie dough.</p><p>Cole has nightmares. Some contraption is crushing him, some ferocious animal is about to devour him, an object he cannot live without is lost or taken away. He cries out, doggy-paddling in the dark. Then there is light, impossibly bright, stabbing his eyes. It is always Pastor Wyatt who comes, never Tracy. Because Tracy never says anything about these nights, Cole thinks maybe she sleeps right through his screams and Pastor Wyatt getting out of bed. He knows married people don't always tell each other everything.</p><p>Pastor Wyatt sits with him for a while, stroking his head, praying with him. Jesus is here, he croons. But it is the smell of those hands that soothes Cole most.</p><p>In the upstairs bathroom one day, he uncaps every bottle and jar till he finds it. The cookie-dough smell is vanilla. It is one of his secrets, how much he loves that smell, and how he sometimes goes into the bathroom just to take a deep whiff. He believes that if he tells anyone, the smell won't have the same effect anymore. It is a secret also because he thinks of it as a girly thing. He pictures Les Wilbur and Peter Druzzi jeering.</p><p><i>Les Wilbur</i>. <i>Peter Druzzi</i>. Cole wonders about them, as he wonders about all the other kids from school. He thinks he remembers that Les was sick, but it could have been Pete. Or it could have been both of them. He wonders if they have passed.</p><p><i>Died. Say died.</i></p><p>Ruthie Lind has passed, that he knows for sure. It happened before Cole himself got sick. Ruthie was one of the first to pass. Jade Korsky? He doesn't know. He and Jade hadn't been in the same school anymore. The closet, the cherry cough drop&#x2014;all that was back in the city. Ages ago. When was the last time he'd played hide-and-seek?</p><p>His mother and his father, both of whom were afraid of dying, have passed.</p><p>The best way to remember them is to remember the good about them.</p><p>He knows that Pastor Wyatt is right. He does not know why it is so hard.</p></p><h2>CP/M bible: The authoritative reference guide to CP/M</h2><p>Clean, straight, no markings that I am aware of.

Reprint.</p><p>Robert Mapplethorpe was one of the most important figures in contemporary photography. Brilliant, daring, and supremely accomplished, he will be remembered for the classical harmonies, controversial subject matter, and luminous vision that marked his photographs. He died in 1989.Patti Smith's foreword, "A Final Flower," is a poetic tribute to the late photographer whose recent retrospective exhibition sparked a national legal debate over censorship in the arts. Smith's observation that Mapplethorpe embraced "the flower as the embodiment of all the contradictions reveling within," and in these photographs "found it was as easy to hurl beauty as anything else," enlarges this work in a meaningful way. The 50 color photographs of flowers taken over the past decade "by one who caused a modern shudder" are surprisingly conventional yet uniquely striking in their composition and lighting; Smith attributes their power to Mapplethorpe's "unflinching perception of the color, form and personality of the flower." The book's simple and sublime presentation--each opening a full-page plate facing a blank--serves to remind us that Mapplethorpe was a masterful photographer, not just an iconoclast.<br><i>- Ann Copeland, Champaign, Ill.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Little Bear&#39;s Valentine (Maurice Sendak&#39;s Little Bear)</h2><p>Little Bear looks forward to giving his mother and the rest of his friends a valentine for Valentine&#39;s Day, and to figuring out who the secret admirer is who sent him one.</p><p><p>Else Holmelund Minarik first introduced readers to her timeless character in the classic Little Bear. The book's publication, with illustrations by Maurice Sendak, launched the I Can Read series. This much-loved author continues to write stories for children at her home in New Hampshire.</p>PreSchool-Grade 2-This story is based on a television series, which in turn was based upon a series of books written by Minarik and illustrated by Sendak. The author has lost none of her ability to gently capture a child's point of view. Little Bear receives a valentine from his secret admirer, and, wondering who it is, he visits all of his friends to deliver valentines and ask their opinions. Readers get to join in the secret, however, as Mother Bear hovers in the background, whispering with each friend as her son leaves. The warm and cozy ending is just right, as all of Little Bear's friends and his secret admirer gather for Valentine cookies. Green's watercolor illustrations employ a soft palette and gentle lines that mediate between Sendak's sketchier style in the original books and the bolder tones of the television series. This is a pitch-perfect picture book with timeless appeal, and a rare example of what can happen when marketing of a classic series is handled with care and respect for the children to whom the books are intended.<br><i>Kathleen Kelly MacMillan, Maryland School for the Deaf, Columbia</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Roar of the Falls: My Journey with Kaya (American Girl)</h2><p>What if you suddenly found yourself in Kaya&#39;s Nez Perce homeland in 1764?

Dido does recover the lost monkey, but its owner only reappears briefly when he finds the dismembered body of a girl in a pile of rubbish sacks across the road from the shop; and although he escapes from police custody and then leaves some of his belongings in Dido&#39;s dustbin for safekeeping, he is found injured in the street nearby, supposed victim of a hit-and-run accident. This bewilders not only Dido, but the local police, and journalist and heartthrob Chris Kennedy who is in the midst of a newspaper investigation into people-trafficking, and even Dido&#39;s father, Professor Barnabas Hoare. Before long, others complicate the problem: DC Ken Acker, who seems to be playing his own game; his injured wife, one of Dido&#39;s oldest customers; two thugs who invade the bookshop; a girl called Nina; and above all Annie Kelly, the retired prostitute trying to make her way in the world with the help of some shoplifting and a bribe from the journalist, Chris. After that, things become a little confusing, and working them out takes all the help and courage Dido can find...and a little more.</p><p>Marianne Macdonald was born in Canada and lived there until the age of twenty, when she went to Oxford to do graduate work. She has lived in England ever since, pursuing an academic career nutil she retired to focus on writing and acting. ""Die Once"" is the sixth book in her Dido Hoare series.<br>Antiquarian book dealer and amateur sleuth Dido Hoare returns in another spirited adventure. A homeless man discovers the torso and arm from a woman's body in a trash bin behind Dido's bookshop. Then other body parts turn up nearby. The police believe the killer is part of an eastern European drug ring trafficking in human parts, but they haven't been able to trace the victims or find the killer. Dido becomes personally involved in the case when a teenager who has been working for the gang seeks asylum with her, and additional body parts are left on the railing outside her home. Neither the reader nor the self-assured Dido is prepared for the shock ending to this very tangled case, which offers up plenty of red herrings and unexpected twists and even some monkey business to lighten the grim but gripping plot. Fans of John Dunning's more hard-boiled series starring antiquarian Cliff Janeway may like this less-cozy-than-usual Dido Hoare adventure. <i>Emily Melton</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Her congressional tenure spanned the administrations of six presidents and three major wars, and marked significant changes in the roles of women in all aspects of American life. For most of her twenty-four years as a senator Smith served as the only woman. She was the first woman to seek the nomination of a major political party for the presidency of the United States. <p>By the time she left office, Senator Smith was the most powerful woman in American politics. From her positions on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Senate Appropriations Committee, and the Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee, she exercised considerable influence over a broad range of military, foreign, and domestic policies. Yet Smith did not view herself as a feminist; In face, she disparaged feminism. For her, success required a special combination of hard work, masked ambition, and proper womanly behavior. </p><p>No Place for a Woman is the first biography to analyze Smith's life and time by using politics and gender as the lens through which we can understand her impact on American politics and American women.

In this expanded and updated edition (now more error-filled than ever), we see just how much the experts don't know.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the book also goes deeper, presenting a through-the-looking-glass chronicle of human knowledge: the story of what was and is so, as seen through the story of what we wanted to and did believe.</p><p>Did you know that the stock market had reached a "permanently high plateau" in October 1929?

Knowing better than to comment directly, they let the reader decide about the (ahem) reliability of the experts.<p> Brilliantly organized, using the categories of Adler's "Outline of Knowledge," <i>The Experts Speak</i> will educate the naive and entertain the cynical with its thousands of well-documented quotes by wise men and women, from Aristotle ("The brain is an organ of minor importance") to Albert Einstein ("There is not the slightest indication that [nuclear]energy will ever be obtainable").

Ron Hubbard, claims to be the world s fastest growing religion, with millions of members around the world and huge financial holdings. Its celebrity believers keep its profile high, and its teams of volunteer ministers offer aid at disaster sites such as Haiti and the World Trade Center. But Scientology is also a notably closed faith, harassing journalists and others through litigation and intimidation, even infiltrating the highest levels of the government to further its goals. Its attacks on psychiatry and its requirement that believers pay as much as tens and even hundreds of thousands of dollars for salvation have drawn scrutiny and skepticism.

Founded by wayward science-fiction writer and historical revisionist <em>par excellence</em> L. Ron Hubbard, "America's Most Secretive Religion" is perhaps best known for high-profile adherents like Tom Cruise and John Travolta, but its tenets, processes, and internal organization form a story as surprising and captivating as that of any investigative work released this year. Reitman's extensive research--including hundreds of interviews with devotees and defectors alike--culminates in an expansive, page-turning survey of the origins, development, crises, beliefs, and scandals of this fascinating incorporated religion, all with a fair-minded approach that favors diligent curiosity over judgment at every turn. "It has been my goal to write the first objective modern history of the Church of Scientology," Reitman writes in the book's introduction, and to this end, <em>Inside Scientology</em> succeeds in spades.

It was almost four in the morning and the auction was only now drawing to a close. A digital display behind the celebrity auctioneer&#x2014;an actor who had played James Bond on-screen for many years&#x2014;showed the running total at more than one million euro.<br><br>&#x201c;Lot number two hundred and ten: a pair of early- nineteenth-century Japanese Kabuki masks.&#x201d;<br><br>A ripple of excitement ran through the crowded room. Inlaid with chips of solid jade, the Kabuki masks were the highlight of the auction and were expected to fetch in excess of half a million euro.<br><br>At the back of the room the tall, thin man with the fuzz of close-cropped snow white hair was prepared to pay twice that.<br><br>Niccol� Machiavelli stood apart from the rest of the crowd, arms lightly folded across his chest, careful not to wrinkle his Savile Row&#x2013;tailored black silk tuxedo. Stone gray eyes swept over the other bidders, analyzing and assessing them. There were really only five others he needed to look out for: two private collectors like himself, a minor European royal, a once-famous American movie actor and a Canadian antiques dealer. The remainder of the audience were tired, had spent their budget or were unwilling to bid on the vaguely disturbing-looking masks.<br><br>Machiavelli loved all types of masks. He had been collecting them for a very long time, and he wanted this particular pair to complete his collection of Japanese theater costumes. These masks had last come up for sale in 1898 in Vienna, and he had then been outbid by a Romanov prince. Machiavelli had patiently bided his time; the masks would come back on the market again when the Prince and his descendents died. Machiavelli knew he would still be around to buy them; it was one of the many advantages of being immortal.<br><br>&#x201c;Shall we start the bidding at one hundred thousand euro?&#x201d;<br><br>Machiavelli looked up, caught the auctioneer&#x2019;s attention and nodded.<br><br>The auctioneer had been expecting his bid and nodded in return. &#x201c;I am bid one hundred thousand euro by Monsieur Machiavelli. Always one of this charity&#x2019;s most generous supporters and sponsors.&#x201d;<br><br>A smattering of applause ran around the room, and several people turned to look at him and raise their glasses. Niccol� acknowledged them with a polite smile.<br><br>&#x201c;Do I have one hundred and ten?&#x201d; the auctioneer asked.<br><br>One of the private collectors raised his hand slightly.<br><br>&#x201c;One-twenty?&#x201d; The auctioneer looked back to Machiavelli, who immediately nodded.<br><br>Within the next three minutes, a flurry of bids brought the price up to two hundred and fifty thousand euro. There were only three serious bidders left: Machiavelli, the American actor and the Canadian.<br><br>Machiavelli&#x2019;s thin lips twisted into a rare smile; his patience was about to be rewarded, and finally the masks would be his. Then the smile faded as he felt the cell phone in his back pocket buzz silently. For an instant he was tempted to ignore it; he&#x2019;d given his staff strict instructions that he was not to be disturbed unless it was absolutely critical. He also knew they were so terrified of him that they would not phone unless it was an emergency. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out the ultraslim phone and glanced down.<br><br>A picture of a sword pulsed gently on the large LCD screen.<br><br>Machiavelli&#x2019;s smile vanished. In that second he knew he was not going to be able to buy the Kabuki masks this century. Turning on his heel, he strode out of the room and pressed the phone to his ear. Behind him, he could hear the auctioneer&#x2019;s hammer hit the lectern &#x201c;Sold. For two hundred and sixty thousand euro . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here,&#x201d; Machiavelli said, reverting to the Italian of his youth.<br><br>The line crackled and an English-accented voice responded in the same language, using a dialect that had not been heard in Europe for more than four hundred years. &#x201c;I need your help.&#x201d;<br><br>The man on the other end of the line didn&#x2019;t identify himself, nor did he need to; Machiavelli knew it was the immortal magician and necromancer Dr. John Dee, one of the most powerful and dangerous men in the world.<br><br>Niccol� Machiavelli strode out of the small hotel into the broad cobbled square of the Place du Tertre and stopped to breathe in the chill night air. &#x201c;What can I do for you?&#x201d; he asked cautiously. He detested Dee and knew the feeling was mutual, but they both served the Dark Elders, and that meant they had been forced to work together down through the centuries. Machiavelli was also slightly envious that Dee was younger than he&#x2014;and looked it. Machiavelli had been born in Florence in 1469, which made him fifty-eight years older than the English Magician. History recorded that he had died in the same year that Dee had been born, 1527.<br><br>&#x201c;Flamel is back in Paris.&#x201d;<br><br>Machiavelli straightened. &#x201c;When?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just now. He got there through a leygate. I&#x2019;ve no idea where it comes out. He&#x2019;s got Scathach with him. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Machiavelli&#x2019;s lips curled into an ugly grimace. The last time he&#x2019;d encountered the Warrior, she&#x2019;d pushed him through a door. It had been closed at the time, and he&#x2019;d spent weeks picking splinters from his chest and shoulders.<br><br>&#x201c;There are two humani children with him. Americans,&#x201d; Dee said, his voice echoing and fading on the transatlantic line. &#x201c;Twins,&#x201d; he added.<br><br>&#x201c;Say again?&#x201d; Machiavelli asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Twins,&#x201d; Dee added, &#x201c;with pure gold and silver auras. You know what that means,&#x201d; he snapped.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Machiavelli muttered. It meant trouble. Then the tiniest of smiles curled his thin lips. It could also mean opportunity.<br><br>Static crackled and then Dee&#x2019;s voice continued. &#x201c;The girl&#x2019;s powers were Awakened by Hekate before the Goddess and her Shadowrealm were destroyed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Untrained, the girl is no threat,&#x201d; Machiavelli murmured, quickly assessing the situation. He took a breath and added, &#x201c;Except perhaps to herself and those around her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Flamel took the girl to Ojai. There, the Witch of Endor instructed her in the Magic of Air.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No doubt you tried to stop them?&#x201d; There was a hint of amusement in Machiavelli&#x2019;s voice.<br><br>&#x201c;Tried. And failed,&#x201d; Dee admitted bitterly. &#x201c;The girl has some knowledge but is without skill.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you want me to do?&#x201d; Machiavelli asked carefully, although he already had a very good idea.<br><br>&#x201c;Find Flamel and the twins,&#x201d; Dee demanded. &#x201c;Capture them. Kill Scathach if you can. I&#x2019;m just leaving Ojai. But it&#x2019;s going to take me fourteen or fifteen hours to get to Paris.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What happened to the leygate?&#x201d; Machiavelli wondered aloud. If a leygate connected Ojai and Paris, then why didn&#x2019;t Dee . . . ?<br><br>&#x201c;Destroyed by the Witch of Endor,&#x201d; Dee raged, &#x201c;and she nearly killed me, too. I was lucky to escape with a few cuts and scratches,&#x201d; he added, and then ended the call without saying good-bye.<br><br>Niccol� Machiavelli closed his phone carefully and tapped it against his bottom lip. Somehow he doubted that Dee had been lucky&#x2014;if the Witch of Endor had wanted him dead, then even the legendary Dr. Dee would not have escaped. Machiavelli turned and walked across the square to where his driver was patiently waiting with the car. If Flamel, Scathach and the American twins had come to Paris via a leygate, then there were only a few places in the city where they could have emerged. It should be relatively easy to find and capture them.<br><br>And if he could capture them tonight, then he would have plenty of time to work on them before Dee arrived.<br><br>Machiavelli smiled; he&#x2019;d only need a few hours, and in that time they would tell him everything they knew.

Yet we moderns miss much of the meaning of Luke's two-part drama because we read it like any other text and not as it would have been <i>heard</i> by ancient listeners -- in public performance by a skilled storyteller.<br><br><i>The Way according to Luke</i> unlocks the big picture of Jesus' mission by attending to the repetition, patterns, and other clues of oral narrative. In this single volume Paul Borgman lays out a holistic view of the organic unity between Luke and Acts while demonstrating that the meaning of Luke-Acts is uniquely embedded in its narrative. Borgman's distinctive work makes available both the satisfying pleasure of reading the Bible as great literature and the rewarding insight gained from receiving Scripture as it was originally delivered.</p><p>Paul Borgman is professor of English at Gordon College,Wenham, Massachusetts. A specialist in biblical narrative,he is also the author of Genesis: The Story We Haven&#39;tHeard. &#34;<b>David P. Moessner</b><br> &#x2014; University of Dubuque<br> "If for the ancient world Pindar characterizes the nature of oral performance ?'aboard the Muses' chariot I beg the eloquence that this occasion needs' ? then Paul Borgman has risen to the occasion. With his 'echoing sequences,' 'spiraling repetitions,' and 'hinge points' for Luke's two-volume performance, Borgman has given us 'winged words' to imprint Luke's own literary genius indelibly into our memories. If narrative performance be judged today by the brilliance of its aural impact, then Borgman has generated a delightfully persuasive movement of Luke's own 'way' of pronouncing the Word of God and moving his audiences to new ways of viewing the story of salvation through Israel's Messiah. This is a command performance for professional and lay reader alike."<br><br><b>Joel B. Green</b><br> &#x2014; author of&nbsp;<i>The Theology of the Gospel of Luke</i><br> "In this exploration of Luke's literary art, Paul Borgman displays his significant gifts as sensitive reader and trusted guide. Although fully engaged with contemporary study of Luke-Acts, he is no slave to 'the experts' as he demonstrates again and again how Luke's narrative works to shape our grasp of Luke's literary and theological agenda. Biblical studies is the richer on account of this sort of interdisciplinary work."<br><br><b>Chuck Stetson</b><br> &#x2014; Bible Literacy Project<br> "Paul Borgman's book on hearing the whole story of Luke-Acts presents rich insights into how these two books of the New Testament represent a dramatic unity and how the structure of oral literature forms the written text that we have today. This is a must-read for those who really want to understand Luke-Acts and the pattern of repetition that yields meaning."<br><br><b>Robert W. Wall</b><br> &#x2014; author of the New Interpreter's Bible commentary on Acts<br> "This fine study from Paul Borgman examines the narrative coherence of Luke's gospel and his Acts from the perspective of an auditor, who likely would have been among the first beneficiaries of Luke's literary masterpiece. Repeated themes and wordplays are 'ear clues' that not only frame the plotline of a good story but more importantly supply the rich texture of the core beliefs of a biblical faith. Borgman's formalist treatment of Luke and Acts amply shows the importance of a careful analysis of literary patterns in guiding the theological interpretation of biblical narrative."<br><br><b>James L. Resseguie</b><br> &#x2014; author of&nbsp;<i>Narrative Criticism of the New Testament</i><br> "Paul Borgman gives us an engaging and lively reading of Luke-Acts that attends to the balanced patterns, narrative echoes, and interlocking themes of Luke's two-part story. By reading the narrative on its own terms as narrative art, Borgman recovers what is often missed &#x2014; a coherent and compelling story of God's message of peace.&nbsp;<i>The Way according to Luke</i>&nbsp;sets high the standard for&nbsp;<i>how</i>&nbsp;to read and hear New Testament narratives, and is certain to stir interest in biblical stories as artistic, unified narratives."<br><br><b><i>Scripture Bulletin</i></b><br> "A splendid example of what literary critics have to teach exegetes. Borgman's insistence on 'Hearing the Whole Story' reminds us importantly that Luke, like all the NT authors, wrote primarily to be heard. . . Read this book for the breath of fresh air that it brings."<br><br><b><i>Review of Biblical Literature</i></b><br> "We need more books like this, where something more substantial can be provided to the general reader in a responsible, well-thought-through, and passionate manner."<br><br><b><i>Catholic Biblical Quarterly</i></b><br> "Borgman presents a readable and accessible study of Luke-Acts. It is that accessibility, along with its conciseness, that distinguishes B.'s treatment from those of his many colleagues. . . An excellent resource for pastors and educators."</p><h2>Fall Leaves Fall!</h2><p>When fall comes, two brothers enjoy catching the falling leaves, stomping on them, kicking them, jumping in piles of them, and using them to make pictures, in a story which includes a description of how leaves change through the year.</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 1-Brightly illustrated and infectiously cheery, this overview of two siblings' favorite time of year gets it just right. The focus is on autumn leaves and all the things these imaginative children do with them. Leaves are for watching, catching, stomping, kicking, and collecting, and big piles of freshly raked leaves are perfect for jumping into. After collecting leaves from their favorite trees, the children label some and make silly pictures with others, two very good ideas for classrooms or home. Maple, ginkgo, sassafras, beech, and two types of oak are represented. The last page shows the sequence of the growth of leaves from spring to winter in very simple terms and mentions that some leaves do not change color or fall off in the fall. Exceptionally well-crafted paper-collage illustrations capture the children's easy exuberance while the simply written text is nicely paced for reading aloud. By the same team responsible for It's Pumpkin Time (Scholastic, 1994), this is a seasonal title you won't want to miss.<br><i>Alicia Eames, New York City Public Schools </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 2-4. Plenty of picture books are set in the autumn, but few capture a young child's experience of the season as succinctly as this one. Watching the leaves fall to the ground, two children try to catch them, then stomp on them, kick them, collect them, compare their shapes, rake them into a pile, and jump into it. The colorful collage illustrations, made of a variety of papers cut into simple forms, are well composed. Their large scale makes the book a natural for sharing with groups of children. With its simple text and appealing illustrations, this picture book seems tailor-made for preschool classes in the fall. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In <i>Egyptomania</i>, Ronald H. Fritze takes us on a historical journey to unearth the Egypt of the past, a place inhabited by strange gods, powerful magic, spell-binding hieroglyphs, and the uncanny, mummified remains of ancient people. Walking among monumental obelisks and through the dark corridors of long-sealed tombs, he reveals a long-standing fascination with an Egypt of incredible wonder and mystery.<br><br> As Fritze shows, Egypt has exerted a powerful force on our imagination. Medieval Christians considered it a holy land with many connections to biblical lore, while medieval Muslims were intrigued by its towering monuments, esoteric sciences, and hidden treasures. People of the Renaissance sought Hermes Trismegistus as the ancient originator of astrology, alchemy, and magic, and those of the Baroque pondered the ciphers of the hieroglyphs. Even the ever-practical Napoleon was enchanted by it, setting out in a costly campaign to walk in the footsteps of Alexander the Great through its valleys, by then considered the cradle of Western civilization. And of course the modern era is one still susceptible to the lure of undiscovered tombs and the curses of pharaohs cast on covetous archeologists.<br><br> Raising ancient Egyptian art and architecture into the light of succeeding history, Fritze offers a portrait of an ancient place and culture that has remained alive through millennia, influencing everything from religion to philosophy to literature to science to popular culture.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Ronald H. Fritze </b>is dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and professor of history at Athens State University. He is the author of many books including <i>Invented Knowledge: False History, Fake Science and Pseudo-religions</i>, also published by Reaktion Books.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Delves into how the realities of Egyptology have been reimagined or misinterpreted as sources of hermeticism, portals to another reality, or tokens to confer knowledge and respectability. . . . Fritze&#x2019;s entertaining and enlightening work does well in separating ancient Egypt&#x2019;s actual legacy from the pseudo-history of occultists and assorted charlatans.&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A broader interpretation of the subject, going back to the Greek historian Herodotus and forward to Cecil B. DeMille and Tutankhamen. . . . Fritze reminds us that what fascinated later artists and their public was not what Egyptologists considered important. Largely self-nourishing, Egyptomania was often detached from its original sources, and the stream of dime novels and films about mummies and their curses have, according to scholars, more to do with Western guilt over imperialism than with the supernatural. Even the artifacts exhumed from Tutankhamen&#x2019;s tomb with great fanfare beginning in 1922 did not, in fact, add much to our knowledge of ancient Egypt, although they were responsible for the museum world&#x2019;s first blockbuster traveling exhibition. . . .

Here, historian Ronald Fritze examines &#x2018;Egyptomania&#x2019; in detail and through time. As Herodotus and other classical scholars extolled Giza&#x2019;s pyramids and the great lighthouse at Alexandria, Egyptian cults and esoteric tracts seeped into Greece and Rome&#x2014;to later fascinate and befuddle medieval and Renaissance scholars. The cracking of hieroglyphs, discovery of Tutankhamun&#x2019;s tomb, and &#x2018;mummymania&#x2019; from the nineteenth century onwards ensured that the craze persists almost unabated today.&#x201d; (<i>Nature</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Informative, entertaining, and comprehensive, this well-written book begins with a concise review of the archaeology of ancient Egypt and moves on to discuss the craze for all things Egyptian.

The argument of University of Alaska historian O'Reilly is just as audacious: he maintains that a "Southern strategy" --" a belief that presidential elections can be won only by following the doctrines and rituals of white over black" --has been "the gut organizing principle of American politics" ever since the Constitutional Convention compromised with slavery. Only Lincoln and LBJ stand as exceptions: despite the former's "white supremacist caveats" and the latter's "surveillance state," these two presidents truly improved African Americans' status and opportunities. After one chapter on "Owners" (Washington to McKinley) and one on "Progressives" (Teddy Roosevelt to Hoover), O'Reilly's remaining seven chapters study the many ways in which presidents from FDR to Clinton--often despite personal goodwill--have "deepened . . . the racial rut" in which "the politics that came out of the Constitution and its articles on slavery" has been stuck for more than two centuries. Provocative history, convincingly argued. <i>Mary Carroll</i></p><h2>The Wind&#39;s Twelve Quarters</h2><p><p>The recipient of numerous literary prizes, including the National Book Award, the Kafka Award, and the Pushcart Prize, Ursula K.

His pursuit of a male heir for his throne led him to cast aside five consecutive wives and bring about the reformation of the Catholic Church, changing the face of British history as he broke from the pope and tradition. But who were the women who were instrumental in causing this change? Why was Catherine of Aragon divorced and Anne Boleyn beheaded, and what happened to the last wife, Catherine Parr?Elizabeth Norton provides a lavishly illustrated guide to the six wives of Henry VIII, exploring their private lives as well as the reasons behind the fundamental changes they caused in Tudor history. With a chapter on each wife, and an extra section on his mistresses, this is the ultimate companion to the six wives of Henry VIII.</p><p>Elizabeth Norton gained her first degree from the University of Cambridge, and her Masters from the University of Oxford.

Of all the Impressionists, it was the man C�zanne called &#x201c;only an eye, but my God what an eye!&#x201d; who stayed completely true to the principle of absolute fidelity to the visual sensation, painting directly from the object.</p><p>It could be said that Monet reinvented the possibilities of color, and whether it was through his early interest in Japanese prints, his time in the dazzling light of Algeria as a conscript, or his personal acquaintance with the major painters of the late 1800s, what Monet produced throughout his long life would change forever the way we perceive both the natural world and its attendant phenomena. The high point of his explorations were the late series of water lilies, painted in his own garden at Giverny, that, in their moves towards almost total formlessness, are really the origin of abstract art.</p><p>This biography does full justice to this most remarkable and profoundly influential of artists, and offers numerous reproductions and archive photos alongside a detailed and insightful commentary.</p></p><p>Daniel Wildenstein (1917-2001) was an art historian and member of the Acad�mie des Beaux-Arts (Paris).

Paul Pacult, is without peer in his meticulous tasting format and fiercely unbiased opinions. The advertising-free nature of his newsletter, <i>F.

Pacult is just as inclined to chastise the distiller of a $1,000 bottle of brandy that falls miserably short of the mark as he is to heap praise upon a $12 bottle of rum that drinks like a $100 bottle of rum.

Memorable and accessible, these early lyrics are presented in their classic incarnations by literary giants from both sides of the Irish Sea: in examples by W. H. Auden, Flann O&#39;Brien, Alfred Lord Tennyson, John Montague, Robert Graves and Frank O&#39;Connor. But the anthology is much more than a survey of canonical texts; through a series of specially commissioned poems, fresh eyes are brought to bear on these ancient poems: by Seamus Heaney and Eil�an N� Chuillean�in, by Paul Muldoon and Kathleen Jamie, by Ciaran Carson and Christopher Reid, and many others. The experience is enhanced still further by the enabling hand of Riordan himself, in a sweep of exquisite translations of his own made especially for this publication.</p><p><b>Maurice Riordan</b> was born in 1953 in Lisgoold, Co. Cork. His first collection, <i>A Word from the Loki</i> (1995) was nominated for the T. S.

In 2013 Riordan was appointed Editor of <i>Poetry Review.</i> He lives in South London.</p><h2>When Washington Burned: An Illustrated History of the War of 1812</h2><p>To commemorate the bicentennial of the War of 1812, this book tells the complete story of the great conflict between a young United States of America and imperial Great Britain. From the roots of the conflict, through a profile of the two armies, to descriptions of the great battles and events of the war this work captures in one lavishly illustrated volume one of America&#x2019;s first great crises.<br><br>Scarcely three decades after the United States won its independence, the massive strength of Mother country returned, seeking to enforce its will on its wayward offspring. The combats were various in scale and ferocity, stretching from the wilds of the Canadian border to the swamps of New Orleans, while on the high seas the fledgling American navy slugged it out bravely with fearsome Brittania, achieving shocking success.<br><br>On land the Americans initially had less luck and witnessed the burning of their new capital at Washington DC by British redcoats, even as a gallant bastion off Baltimore continued to hold its flag high beneath the &#x201c;rockets&#x2019; red glare.&#x201d; Though unnecessary at the end for geopolitical purposes (the war had already ended), General Andrew Jackson punctuated the conflict profoundly with a disastrous defeat of Wellington&#x2019;s veterans near the Crescent City. <br><br>Author Arnold Blumberg is a Visiting Scholar at the History Department of Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, and a contributor to a number of leading military history journals.

The illustrations include period paintings, sketches, photographs, and a few other images of land and sea battles and the key personalities of the war." (<i>Book News, Inc.</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;...Without drowning me in too much detail, When Washington Burned by Arnold Blumberg proved to be an excellent overview of the reasons both sides had to go to war and then ultimately seek to end what was really a pointless conflict. The battle information included brief histories of the commanding officers involved, the units involved, main maneuvers and casualties all accompanied by plenty of contemporary illustrations and some maps.If you want to put the war at sea into context with the land engagements this is a good book to start with.&#x201d; (<i>Historical Naval Fiction</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;...spectacular and lavishly illustrated one volume treatise on America&#x2019;s First Great War as a united independent nation....features many rare illustrations, good maps, and an easy to grasp writing narrative style...a very good treatise on a much overlooked war.&#x201d; (<i>Sea Classics</i>)<br><br>"...an understandable account out of this disjointed war...The structure used has each chapter covering a distinct area. They are restricted to a geographic area. The genius of this approach is let you keep needed focus without covering everything happening on all fronts at the same time. The coverage of the Naval engagements is excellent. They receive their separate chapters.The illustrations are first-rate. The majority of the images are present-day. He makes skillful use of maps to show the more intricate campaigns. This is an excellent single volume history of the War of 1812. It explains what happened. It explains why it happened. The coverage is balanced with US and British material. The book would be an great addition for community libraries, school libraries and is a must for the personal library of military historians. It would also make a nice &#x201c;coffee table book&#x201d;.Arnold Blumberg and Casemate Publishing have provide a well needed, quality book on the War of 1812. (<i>Kepler&#x2019;s Military History</i>)<br><br>"If one is looking for a book that summarizes the Second War of Independence, as the War of 1812 has often been called, this is the book. There is something in this book for the aficionado as well as for the uninitiated.&nbsp; When Washington Burned&nbsp;is a beautifully bound and richly illustrated volume that takes the reader through the war, start to finish." (<i>What Would the Founders Think?</i>)</p><h2>On the Apostolic Tradition (St. Vladimir&#39;s Seminary Press &#34;Popular Patristics&#34; Series)</h2><p><p><i>Apostolic Tradition</i>, as this text is best known, was identified in the early years of the twentieth century as the work of Hippolytus, a Christian leader from third-century Rome. The text provides liturgical information of great antiquity, and as such has been massively influential on liturgical study and reform, especially in western churches. </p><p>Nonetheless, there have been a number of problems surrounding the text. The attribution to Hippolytus has never been universally accepted; much of the text remained obscure, published without commentary; finally, no adequate English version has been published since 1937. <i>On the Apostolic Tradition</i> seeks to solve these problems. The introduction brings the debate concerning authorship to a new level while the rest of the text is accompanied by lucid commentary. Together with a fresh translation, the book brings light to formerly obscure passages, clears critical impasses and provides new discoveries. It is a significant and important piece of research, enlightening and eminently readable. </p><p><i>Alistair Stewart-Sykes is a leading scholar of Christian liturgical origins. The author of numerous books and articles on early Christianity and its liturgy, he had retired from teaching and is a vicar in the Diocese of Salisbury, England.</i> <br> <br> <i>On the Apostolic Tradition</i> is part of the POPULAR PATRISTIC SERIES.</p></p><p></p><h2>BOOK OF ORDER - THE CONSTITUTION OF THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH (U.S.A.)

Radical Christian gnosis and the conviction that poetry should be more than a display of word-craft distinguished him from poets like T. S.

Edie Sedgwick exploded into the public eye like a comet. She seemed to have it all: she was aristocratic and glamorous, vivacious and young, Andy Warhol's superstar. But within a few years she flared out as quickly as she had appeared, and before she turned twenty-nine she was dead from a drug overdose. <p>In a dazzling tapestry of voices--family, friends, lovers, rivals--the entire meteoric trajectory of Edie Sedgwick's life is brilliantly captured. And so is the Pop Art world of the '60s: the sex, drugs, fashion, music--the mad rush for pleasure and fame. All glitter and flash on the outside, it was hollow and desperate within--like Edie herself, and like her mentor, Andy Warhol. Alternately mesmerizing, tragic, and horrifying, this book shattered many myths about the '60s experience in America. </p><p>"This is the book of the Sixties that we have been waiting for."--Norman Mailer </p><p>"Through a kaleidoscope of seemingly fragmented voices, patterns form, giving brilliant definition to the very American tragedy of Edie Sedgwick, a woman...not likely to be forgotten after this haunting portrait."--Publishers Weekly </p><p>"Extraordinary...a fascinating narrative that is both meticulously reported and expertly orchestrated."--The New York Times </p><p>"An exceptionally seductive biography....

She thought, Shit. Go away. Were there people who actually welcomed unannounced visitors when they just stopped by to &#x201c;say hello&#x201d; or &#x201c;check in&#x201d;? Recluses, probably. Or those friendly Midwestern folks she&#x2019;d seen depicted in Big Love but had never actually met&#x2014;yes, they probably didn&#x2019;t mind. But this! This was an affront. Monday nights were sacred and completely off-limits to the rest of the world, a time of No Human Contact when Leigh could veg out in sweats and watch episode after beautiful TiVo&#x2019;d episode of Project Runway. It was her only time alone all week, and after some intensive training on her part, her friends, her family, and her boyfriend, Russell, finally abided by it.<br><br>The girls had stopped asking for Monday-night plans at the end of the nineties; Russell, who in the beginning of their relationship had openly balked, now quietly contained his resentment (and in football season relished having his own Monday nights free); her mother struggled through one night a week without picking up the phone to call, finally accepting after all these years that she wouldn&#x2019;t hear from Leigh until Tuesday morning no matter how many times she hit Redial. Even Leigh&#x2019;s publisher knew better than to assign her Monday-night reading...or, god forbid, knew not to log an interrupting phone call. Which is precisely why it was so incredible that her doorbell had just rung&#x2014;incredible and panic-inducing.<br><br>Figuring it was her super, there to change the air-conditioning filter; or one of the delivery guys from Hot Enchiladas, leaving a menu; or, most likely of all, someone just confusing her door with one of her neighbors&#x2019;, she hit Mute on the TV remote and did not move a muscle. She cocked her head to the side like a Labrador, straining for any confirmation that the intruder had left, but the only thing she heard was the dull, constant thudding from above. Suffering from what her old shrink called &#x201c;noise sensitivity&#x201d; and everyone else described as &#x201c;fucking neurotic,&#x201d; Leigh had, of course, thoroughly scoped out her upstairs neighbor before signing over her life savings: The apartment might have been the most perfect she&#x2019;d seen in a year and a half of looking, but she hadn&#x2019;t wanted to take any chances.<br><br>Leigh had asked Adriana for the scoop on the woman above her, in apartment 17D, but her friend had just pursed her pouty lips and shrugged. No matter that Adriana had lived in the building&#x2019;s full-floor penthouse apartment from the day her parents had moved from S�o Paulo to New York nearly two decades before; she had completely embraced the New Yorker&#x2019;s I-Promise-Not-to-Acknowledge-You-If-You-Extend-Me-the-Same-Courtesy attitude toward her neighbors and could offer Leigh no info on her neighbor. And so, on a blustery December Saturday right before Christmas, Leigh had slipped the building&#x2019;s doorman twenty bucks, Bond-style, and waited in the lobby, pretending to read a manuscript. After Leigh spent three hours scanning the same anecdote, the doorman coughed loudly and looked at her over the top of his glasses with meaning. Glancing up, Leigh felt an immediate wave of relief. Before her, removing a QVC catalog from an unlocked mailbox, stood an overweight woman in a polka-dot housedress. Not a day younger than eighty, thought Leigh, and she breathed a sigh of relief; there would be no stilettos clacking against the hardwood floors, no late-night parties, no parade of visitors stomping around.<br><br>The very next day Leigh wrote a check for the down payment, and two months later she excitedly moved into her mint-condition one-bedroom dream apartment. It had a renovated kitchen, an oversized bathtub, and a more than decent northern view of the Empire State Building. It might have been one of the smallest units in the building&#x2014;okay, the smallest&#x2014;but it was still a dream, a beautiful, lucky dream in a building Leigh never thought she could afford, each and every obscenely priced square foot paid for with her own hard work and savings.<br><br>How could she possibly have predicted that the seemingly innocuous upstairs neighbor was a dedicated wearer of massive wooden orthopedic clogs? Still, Leigh berated herself regularly for thinking high heels were the only potential noise risk: it had been an amateur&#x2019;s mistake. Before she&#x2019;d spotted her neighbor wearing the offending shoes, Leigh had created an elaborate explanation for the relentless upstairs racket. She decided that the woman had to be Dutch (since everyone knew Dutch people wore clogs), and the matriarch of a huge, proudly Dutch family who received constant visits from countless children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, siblings, cousins, and general advice-seekers...all, most likely, Dutch clog-wearers. After spotting her neighbor wearing an air cast and feigning interest in the woman&#x2019;s disgusting-sounding foot ailments including (but not limited to) plantar fasciitis, ingrown toenails, neuromas, and bunions, Leigh had clucked as sympathetically as she could manage and then raced upstairs to check her copy of the co-op rules. Sure enough, they dictated that owners were required to cover eighty percent of their hardwood floors with carpet&#x2014;which she realized was an entirely moot point when the very next page revealed that her upstairs neighbor was president of the board.<br><br>Leigh had already endured nearly four months of round-the-clock clogging, something that might have been funny if it was happening to someone else. Her nerves were directly tied to the volume and frequency of the steady thump-thump-thump that segued into a thumpety-thump-thumpety-thump-thump pattern when Leigh&#x2019;s heart began to pound right along with it. She tried to breathe slowly, but her exhales were short and raspy, punctuated by little guppy gasps. As she examined her pale complexion (which on good days she thought of as &#x201c;ethereal&#x201d; and all other times accepted as &#x201c;sickly&#x201d;) in the mirrored hallway closet door, a thin sheen of perspiration dampened her forehead.<br><br>It seemed to be happening more frequently, this sweating/breathing issue&#x2014;and not just when she heard the wood-on-wood banging. Sometimes Leigh would awaken from a sleep so deep it almost hurt, only to find her heart racing and her sheets drenched. Last week in the middle of an otherwise completely relaxing shavasna&#x2014;albeit one where the instructor felt compelled to play an a capella version of &#x201c;Amazing Grace&#x201d; over the speakers&#x2014;a sharp pain shot through Leigh&#x2019;s chest on each measured inhale. And just this morning as she watched the human tidal wave of commuters cram onto the N train&#x2014;she forced herself to take the subway, but hated every second of it&#x2014;Leigh&#x2019;s throat constricted and her pulse inexplicably quickened. There seemed to be only two plausible explanations, and although she could be a bit of a hypochondriac, even Leigh didn&#x2019;t think she was a likely candidate for a coronary: It was a panic attack, plain and simple.<br><br>In an ineffective attempt to dispel the panic, Leigh pressed her fingertips into her temples and stretched her neck from side to side, neither of which did a damn thing. It felt like her lungs could reach only ten percent capacity, and just as she considered who would find her body&#x2014;and when&#x2014;she heard a choked sobbing and yet another ring of her doorbell.<br><br>She tiptoed over to the door and looked through the peephole but saw only empty hallway. This was exactly how people ended up robbed and raped in New York City&#x2014;getting duped by some criminal mastermind into opening their doors. I&#x2019;m not falling for this, she thought as she stealthily dialed her doorman. Never mind that her building&#x2019;s security rivaled the UN&#x2019;s, or that in eight years of city living she didn&#x2019;t personally know anyone who&#x2019;d been so much as pickpocketed, or that the chances of a psychopathic murderer choosing her apartment from more than two hundred other units in her building was unlikely.... This was how it all started.<br><br>The doorman answered after four eternally long rings.<br><br>&#x201c;Gerard, it&#x2019;s Leigh Eisner in 16D. There&#x2019;s someone outside my door. I think they&#x2019;re trying to break in. Can you come up here right away? Should I call 911?&#x201d; The words came out in a frantic jumble as Leigh paced the small foyer and popped Nicorette squares into her mouth directly from the foil wrapper.<br><br>&#x201c;Miss Eisner, of course I&#x2019;ll send someone up immediately, but perhaps you&#x2019;re mistaking Miss Solomon for someone else? She arrived a few minutes ago and proceeded directly to your apartment...which is permissible for someone on your permanent clearance list.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Emmy&#x2019;s here?&#x201d; Leigh asked. She forgot all about her imminent death by disease or homicide and pulled open her door to find Emmy rocking back and forth on the hallway floor, knees pulled tight against her chest, cheeks slick with tears.<br><br>&#x201c;Miss, may I be of further assistance? Shall I still&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks for your help, Gerard. We&#x2019;re fine now,&#x201d; Leigh said, snapping shut her cell phone and shoving it into the kangaroo pocket of her sweatshirt. She dropped to her knees without thinking and wrapped her arms around Emmy.<br><br>&#x201c;Honey, what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; she crooned, gathering Emmy&#x2019;s tear-dampened hair from her face into a ponytail. &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;<br><br>The show of concern brought with it a fresh stream of tears; Emmy was sobbing so hard her tiny body trembled. Leigh ran through the possibilities of what could cause such pain, and came up with only three: a death in the family, a pending death in the family, or a man.<br><br>&#x201c;Sweetie, is it your parents? Did something happen to them? To Izzie?&#x201d;<br><br>Emmy shook her head.<br><br>&#x201c;Talk to me, Emmy. Is everything okay with Duncan?&#x201d;<br><br>This elicited a wail so plaintive it hurt Leigh to hear it. Bingo.<br><br>&#x201c;Over,&#x201d; Emmy cried, her voice catching in her throat. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s over for good.&#x201d;<br><br>Emmy had made this pronouncement no fewer than eight times in the five years she and Duncan had been dating, but something about tonight seemed different.<br><br>&#x201c;Honey, I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s all just&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He met someone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He what?&#x201d; Leigh dropped her arms and sat back on her ankles.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, let me rephrase: I bought him someone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What on earth are you talking about?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Remember when I got him a membership at Clay for his thirty-first birthday because he was desperate to get back in shape? And then he never went&#x2014;not one fucking time in two whole years&#x2014;because, according to him, it wasn&#x2019;t &#x2018;an efficient use of his time&#x2019; to just go and stand on the treadmill? So rather than just cancel the whole damn thing and forget about it, I, genius extraordinaire, decide to buy him a series of sessions with a personal trainer so he wouldn&#x2019;t have to waste one precious second exercising like everyone else.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think I can see where this is going.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What? You think he fucked her?&#x201d; Emmy laughed mirthlessly. It sometimes surprised people to hear Emmy trash-talk with such ferocity&#x2014;she was, after all, only five-one and looked no older than a teenager&#x2014;but Leigh barely even noticed anymore. &#x201c;I thought so, too. It&#x2019;s so much worse than that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That sounds bad enough, sweetheart.&#x201d; All-out loving sympathy and support were the best she could offer, but Emmy didn&#x2019;t appear comforted.<br><br>&#x201c;You probably wonder how it could get worse, right? Well, let me tell you how. He didn&#x2019;t just fuck her&#x2014;I could maybe deal with that. Noooo, not my Duncan. He &#x2018;fell in love&#x2019; with her.&#x201d; Emmy jabbed out air quotes with the forefingers and middle fingers of both hands and rolled her bloodshot eyes. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s &#x2018;waiting for her,&#x2019; quote-unquote, until she&#x2019;s &#x2018;ready.&#x2019; She&#x2019;s a VIRGIN, for chrissake! I&#x2019;ve put up with five years of his cheating and lies and kinky, weird sex so he can FALL IN LOVE WITH A VIRGIN TRAINER I HIRED IN THE GYM I PAID FOR? In love! Leigh, what am I going to do?&#x201d;<br><br>Leigh, relieved that she could finally do something tangible, took Emmy&#x2019;s arm and helped her to her feet. &#x201c;Come in, honey. Let&#x2019;s go inside. I&#x2019;ll make us some tea and you can tell me what happened.&#x201d;<br><br>Emmy sniffed. &#x201c;Oh, god, I forgot...it&#x2019;s Monday. I don&#x2019;t want to interrupt. I&#x2019;ll be fine....&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be ridiculous. I wasn&#x2019;t even doing anything,&#x201d; Leigh lied. &#x201c;Come in this minute.&#x201d;<br><br>Leigh led her to the couch and, after patting the overstuffed arm to indicate where Emmy should rest her head, ducked behind the wall that separated the living room from the kitchen. With its speckled granite countertops and new stainless steel appliances, the kitchen was Leigh&#x2019;s favorite room in the whole apartment. All of her pots and pans hung from under-cabinet hooks in order of size, and all of her utensils and spices were obsessively organized in matching glass and stainless containers. Crumbs, spills, wrappers, dirty dishes&#x2014;all nonexistent. The refrigerator looked like someone had Hoovered it clean, and the countertops were entirely smudge-free. If it was possible for a room to personify its owner&#x2019;s neurotic personality, the kitchen and Leigh could be identical twins.<br><br>She filled the kettle (purchased just last week during a Bloomingdale&#x2019;s Home Sale, because who said you were entitled to new things only when you registered?), piled a tray high with cheese and Wheat Thins, and peeked through the window into the living room to make sure Emmy was resting comfortably. Seeing that she was lying flat on her back with an arm flung over her eyes, Leigh slipped out her cell phone and selected Adriana&#x2019;s name from her phone book. She typed: SOS. E &amp; D finished. Get down here ASAP.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have Advil?&#x201d; Emmy called from the couch. And then, more quietly: &#x201c;Duncan always carried Advil.&#x201d;<br><br>Leigh opened her mouth to add that Duncan had always carried a lot of things&#x2014;a business card for his favorite escort service, a wallet-sized picture of himself as a child, and, occasionally, a genital wart or two that he swore were just &#x201c;skin tags&#x201d;&#x2014;but she controlled herself. In addition to being unnecessary since Emmy was suffering enough, it would be hypocritical: Contrary to everyone&#x2019;s belief, Leigh wasn&#x2019;t exactly in the world&#x2019;s most perfect relationship, either. But she pushed the thought of Russell from her mind.<br><br>&#x201c;Sure, I&#x2019;ll get you some in a minute,&#x201d; she said, turning off the whistling kettle. &#x201c;Tea&#x2019;s ready.&#x201d;<br><br>The girls had just taken their first sips when the doorbell rang. Emmy looked at Leigh, who just said, &#x201c;Adriana.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s open!&#x201d; Leigh called toward the front door, but Adriana had already figured that out. She stormed into the living room and stood with her hands on her hips, surveying the scene.<br><br>&#x201c;What is going on here?&#x201d; she demanded. Adriana&#x2019;s slight Brazilian accent, little more than a soft, sexy lilting when she was calm, made her almost unintelligible when she felt, in her own words, &#x201c;passionate&#x201d; about someone or something. Which was pretty much always. &#x201c;Where are the drinks?&#x201d;<br><br>Leigh motioned to the kitchen. &#x201c;Water&#x2019;s still hot. Check the cupboard above the microwave. I have a whole bunch of different flavors in&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No tea!&#x201d; Adriana screeched and pointed to Emmy. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you see she&#x2019;s miserable? We need real drinks. I&#x2019;ll make caipirinhas.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have any mint. Or limes. Actually, I&#x2019;m not even sure I have the right booze,&#x201d; Leigh said.<br><br>&#x201c;I brought everything.&#x201d; Adriana lifted a large paper bag over her head and grinned.<br><br>Leigh often found Adriana&#x2019;s abruptness irritating, sometimes a little overwhelming, but tonight she was grateful to her for taking control of the situation. It had been nearly twelve years since Leigh first saw Adriana&#x2019;s smile, and still it left her feeling awestruck and a little anxious.

She brought him home, splinted his mangled legs, and all he had to do in return was write a very special book, one all about her favourite character. Because if he didn&#39;t, if he was bad, she would be cross - very cross.</p><p>In <i>Misery</i> (1987), as in <i>The Shining</i> (1977), a writer is trapped in an evil house during a Colorado winter. Each novel bristles with claustrophobia, stinging insects, and the threat of a lethal explosion. Each is about a writer faced with the dominating monster of his unpredictable muse.<p> Paul Sheldon, the hero of <i>Misery</i>, sees himself as a caged parrot who must return to Africa in order to be free. Thus, in the novel within a novel, the romance novel that his mad captor-nurse, Annie Wilkes, forces him to write, he goes to Africa--a mysterious continent that evokes for him the frightening, implacable solidity of a woman's (Annie's) body. The manuscript fragments he produces tell of a great Bee Goddess, an African queen reminiscent of H. Rider Haggard's <i>She</i>.</p><p> He hates her, he fears her, he wants to kill her; but all the same he needs her power. Annie Wilkes literally breathes life into him. </p><p> <i>Misery</i> touches on several large themes: the state of possession by an evil being, the idea that art is an act in which the artist willingly becomes captive, the tortured condition of being a writer, and the fears attendant to becoming a "brand-name" bestselling author with legions of zealous fans. And yet it's a tight, highly resonant echo chamber of a book--one of King's shortest, and best novels ever. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Stephen King is the bestselling author of more than thirty books of which the most recent are THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON, HEARTS IN ATLANTIS and his non-fiction book ON WRITING.

But to cement his grip on power, the Nazi dictator was reliant on an inner circle of henchmen who dedicated themselves entirely to his service. So who were these men who smoothed Hitler s path to power and became the perpetrators of a reign of terror unparalleled in history? What drove them to warmongering and mass murder, to unquestioning obedience and manic racial hatred? <p>Since the early 1980s Guido Knopp has talked to countless people who knew Hitler s paladins. He has interviewed family members, friends, colleagues and other eyewitnesses; and his has gained access to personal papers. His meticulous research has also uncovered new material from British and Russian archives. Here he draws the political and personal profiles of the men behind Hitler, men who became the most important pillars of the Nazi dictatorship. </p><p>Goebbels, G�ring, Himmler, Hess, Speer and D�nitz: these were the supporters and executives of Hitler s regime, carrying out his orders with deadly efficiency. Their significance in the web of Nazi power and the extent of their implication in its crimes differed greatly. Yet their psychological profiles have one thing in common: they all provide answers to how the atrocities of the Nazi era came to be committed. </p><p>This radical new assessment of power under the swastika scrutinizes the leading personalities of the Third Reich.

Between mouthfuls of food and over the polite scrapings of cutlery, the conversation remains a gentle hum of polite discourse -- the banality of work, the triviality of the holidays. But behind the empty words, terrible things need to be said, and with every forced smile and every new course, the knives are being sharpened.<br> Each couple has a fifteen-year-old son. The two boys are united by their accountability for a single horrific act; an act that has triggered a police investigation and shattered the comfortable, insulated worlds of their families. As the dinner reaches its culinary climax, the conversation finally touches on their children. As civility and friendship disintegrate, each couple show just how far they are prepared to go to protect those they love.<br> Tautly written, incredibly gripping, and told by an unforgettable narrator, "The Dinner" promises to be the topic of countless dinner party debates.

Paul's 15-year-old son, Michel, has committed an unspeakable crime; his brother, on the cusp of becoming the Netherlands' next prime minister, has a delicate wife and two teenagers who share Michel&#x2019;s secret; Paul's wife, Claire, will do anything to protect their boy. As the two couples inch through an excruciating meal at a chic restaurant--their children's whereabouts uncertain--Paul peels back the layers of their situation, weaving to and fro through time and truth. Koch's finely structured story gives away just enough on each page to keep us riveted, feeling like private investigators on the verge of discovery, until the shock of an ending. It's no small feat for the author that the less we trust Paul, the more we want to hear what he has to say. --<em>Mia Lipman</em><p>HERMAN KOCH is the author of seven novels and three collections of short stories.

Historian Dr. David Harrison reconstructs the hidden history of the movement, tracing its roots through a mixture of mediaeval guild societies, alchemy and necromancy. He examines the earliest known Freemasons and their obsessions with Solomon s Temple, alchemy, and prophecy, to the formation of the Grand Lodge in London, which in turn led to rebellions within the Craft throughout England. Harrison also analyzes the role of French immigrant, Dr Jean Theophilus Desaguliers in the development of English Freemasonry, focusing on his involvement with the formation of the mysterious modern Masonic ritual. All Freemasons and more general readers will find much of interest in this fascinating exploration of the very beginnings of Freemasonry, still one of the most mysterious brotherhoods in the world.</p><p>This book was the culmination of my PhD work at the University of Liverpool, which I submitted in December 2007, and successfully defended in March 2008.&nbsp; A year later, the thesis was published as <i>The Genesis of Freemasonry</i> by Lewis Masonic.&nbsp; It was suggested by Dr. William Ashworth, my supervisor during my PhD research that the thesis would perhaps find a more suitable home with a popular publisher, or a publisher with a Masonic background, and when Lewis Masonic became interested, that suitable home was found.&nbsp; The book was first published in March 2009, and despite the controversy that surrounded it, the book was a success.<br> The work can be found in many Masonic and University libraries around the world, and demand has led to the publication of this revised second edition.&nbsp; It has allowed me not only to correct grammatical errors that existed from the original Lewis Masonic edition, but to extend the bibliography and index, and to add more references which can act as a guide to the reader.&nbsp; I wanted the work to reflect the original thesis as much as possible, so resisted altering too much of the writing and faithfully kept to the essence of the original work.&nbsp; Additional photos and illustrations were also added.<br> This book launched my career as a Masonic historian, researcher and author.&nbsp; I hope it goes on to inspire further Masonic research and continues to stir passions.Dr David Harrison is a UK based Masonic historian who has so far written three books on the history of English Freemasonry and has contributed articles on the subject to various magazines which deal with the topic of Freemasonry around the world, such as the UK based Freemasonry Today, MQ Magazine, the Square, the US based Knight Templar Magazine, Philalethes and the Australian based New Dawn Magazine. Harrison has also appeared on TV and radio discussing his work.<br> Having gained his PhD from the University of Liverpool in 2008 which focused on the development of English Freemasonry, the thesis was subsequently published in March 2009 entitled The Genesis of Freemasonry by Lewis Masonic, and his second work entitled The Transformation of Freemasonry was published by Arima Publishing the following year. Both works received critical acclaim. His work on The Liverpool Masonic Rebellion and the Wigan Grand Lodge was published by Arima in October 2012, which was followed by&nbsp;A Quick Guide to Freemasonry in 2013 and The York Grand Lodge in 2014. His latest work Freemasonry and Fraternal Societies is published in July 2015.</p><h2>The Laws of Choice: Predicting Customer Behavior</h2><p>How do customers decide what products and brands to buy? With the rise of sophisticated advertising and marketing research methods in this century, business leaders have spent billions of dollars attempting to answer this perplexing question. Occasionally, analysts emerge with suggestive trends, but ultimately with little hard evidence to support any definitive "laws" of customer choice. <br> Now, in this much-anticipated major work, Eric Marder reveals how universal patterns in survey responses lead not only to general principles in marketing but to empirically verifiable laws of human nature itself. Drawing on forty years of applying his pioneering experimental design techniques to marketing research surveys, Marder presents a global theory of choice behavior, supported by original data reported here for the first time from thousands of massive real-life experiments based on millions of interviews. His dramatic findings about pricing, optimal marketing tactics, product evaluation, the relative role of product and image, and advertising effectiveness will make this book required reading for the entire marketing community. Of special interest to social scientists and survey research practitioners will be Marder's powerful research designs and techniques, including the unbounded write-in scale for measuring desirability (attitude) and his methodological analyses of the relationships among beliefs (perceptions), desires, choice, and behavior. <br> In the Preface, he writes: "At the core of the theory are three laws of choice behavior the Law of Congruence, the Law of Primacy, and the Law of Persistence. These laws are both general and self-evident. At first glance, they are so self-evident that you might say: 'I have known this all along.' My reply is: 'Of course you have known it all along. But there is a difference between knowing and knowing, between the passive knowing that allows us to persist in actions that are inconsistent with what we know, and the active knowing that helps us change the way we do things.' I believe that knowing the laws of choice behavior-really knowing them -- changes the way we do things. My crass but stringent criterion has been that a good theory should enable someone equipped with it to make more money than someone who isn't. I believe my theory has passed this test."</p><p>Eric Marder is Chairman of Eric Marder Associates, Inc., a marketing research and consulting firm he founded in 1960. The company specializes in "Choice Research," a term Marder uses to distinguish the discipline presented in this book from traditional marketing research.

I was working in survey research. Superficially, surveys are a commonsense matter. One asks questions. One gets answers. One analyzes and reports the results. But my ambition went beyond that. I had an intuition that what happens in a survey, or what could be made to happen if one approached it in the right way, is of greater significance than meets the eye. If one thinks of every question as a stimulus, if one thinks of every answer as a response, if one focuses not on what is said, attributing literal meaning to it, but on the fact that it is said, then the response constitutes a special kind of behavior which should be psychologically meaningful.<br><br>My ambition was to open a path to those aspects of human nature that become most peculiarly accessible by examining what happens when questions are asked and answers are given. I was not concerned with how people felt about any particular subject, be it toilet paper or nuclear energy, an inquiry I held to be equally trivial in both cases, but with the universal pattern hidden in the responses, which would, at the appropriate level of generality, lead to principles and laws, not laws about toilet paper or nuclear energy, but laws about patterns of responses and hence about some aspects of human nature itself.<br><br>In 1951, I was contacted by the head of a prestigious graduate school and invited to join the faculty to attempt to develop a theory of marketing. I had hardly ever heard the word and thought of it more as having to do with getting my groceries home than as a serious field of study. After some soul-searching, I declined. Marketing, or what I thought it was, seemed frivolous to me. I wanted to continue to think about the embryonic science of questions and answers. Several years later, I went to work at Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt, then one of the ten largest advertising agencies in the country. The understanding was that I would continue to think about questions and answers but, in the new environment of the advertising agency, would channel these efforts into measuring the effectiveness of advertising and helping the agency's clients sell their products.<br><br>In 1960 I left Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt to found Eric Marder Associates, Inc. (called "EMA" throughout this book). By then I was submerged in marketing research. To be sure, the central tool was still the survey. I was still asking questions and collecting answers. I was still thinking about the structure of these questions and about the general principles that might be extracted from them. But the emphasis had shifted entirely to looking for better ways of helping clients market products. To do this effectively, it became imperative to understand the client's problem, not in the vague terms he was prone to use in articulating it, not even in the way he actually thought about it, but in the way he should have thought about it. This became dramatically clear to me when I met a high-ranking marketing executive who said expansively, "We want to do a study to find out why Mercury isn't selling this year."<br><br>"No," I replied.<br><br>He was half startled, half shocked.<br><br>"I damn well know what I want to do," he said.<br><br>"I believe you want to do a study to find out what you can do to sell more Mercurys this year."<br><br>"But that's the same thing."<br><br>"It's not quite the same thing," I replied. "If I took the assignment at face value, I would do a study among people who have just bought some other car. I might find out that they considered a Mercury but decided against it because they didn't like the look of the front end. This would give you the right answer to your question, but it wouldn't do you any good. If I want to give you a useful answer, I must study people who haven't bought a car and find out what, if anything, I could promise them or do for them to induce them to buy a Mercury in spite of the fact that they don't like the look of the front end."<br><br>It became clear to me that assignments could not be taken at face value. The important thing was not to listen to what the client said he wanted, but to what he really wanted, or to what he should have wanted, or to what he could be made to see he wanted if the issues were properly dissected for him. I also realized that much marketing research was doomed from the outset. For how could it hope to generate the right answer if it had not addressed the right question?<br><br>This led me to ponder what the right questions were, and so I began to think about marketing. Before long, a theory began to emerge, an orderly way of looking at the problems every marketer must face and solve one way or another. Given my temperament, I made every effort to think in general terms, so the theory would apply with equal force to the marketing of a paper towel, a computer, a presidential candidate, a religion, or anything else someone might attempt to induce people to choose. Ironically, I had come full circle. In the end, I was thinking about marketing after all and was thus carrying out the very assignment I had arrogantly rejected as a young man. Arrogantly indeed, though perhaps not foolishly. Because even though the theory I offer now is so elementary that I should have been able to articulate it after a little thought, I confess that it has taken many years before I was able to strip it of involutions and complications, of big words and technical jargon, and reduce it to the commonsense form in which it is presented below.<br><br><b><i>Nomenclature</i></b><br><br>What is marketing? There is, of course, no right answer. Definitions can be neither right nor wrong. But definitions do matter, for they are the tools we use in thinking about things. And some definitions can be more useful than others in helping us think clearly and arrive at answers we might have missed otherwise. In that spirit, I believe it is useful to think of marketing as a game played by <i>N</i> players (the marketers), each equipped with chips (their respective budgets). The players make moves on a board (the principles governing choice behavior) by adjusting eight dials (the eight tools of marketing). To understand the game, we need to understand the board on which it is played. So I begin by describing that board, using the terms <i>marketer, brand, customer,</i> and <i>choice.</i><br><br>The initial meaning of these terms is self-evident. The <i>marketer</i> is the provider of goods or services, such as automobiles, soap, paging, coffee, or computers. The <i>brand</i> is whatever the marketer is trying to sell. The <i>choice</i> is the selection of one brand from a set of brands. And the <i>customer</i> is the person who makes the choice. The marketer may also be a campaign manager, the brand a political candidate, the choice an election, and the customer a voter. In general, these terms, as well as the principles and methods dealt with in this book, are intended to apply to any situation in which:<br><br>Someone, anyone, (the <i>marketer)</i> is trying to induce someone, anyone (the <i>customer)</i> to make some selection, any selection (the <i>choice)</i> in favor of something, anything (the marketer's <i>brand),</i> often aided and abetted by a <i>researcher</i> whose job it is to subject the process to scientific scrutiny and to support it with empirical evidence.<br><br>Given the intrinsic limitations of the English language, which does not have gender-free pronouns, and being unwilling to use the awkward <i>he or she,</i> I am arbitrarily assigning genders to the cast of characters. The marketer shall be a <i>she;</i> the customer shall be a <i>she;</i> the researcher shall be a he. With some limited partiality, I am thus reserving my own gender for the actor with whom I identify most closely. I trust no one will take offense if the brand remains an <i>it,</i> even though it may on occasion be a political candidate.<br><br>A word of warning. This chapter consists of definitions, distinctions, and descriptions of commonplace events. I have taken pains to present these in the simplest terms possible. In doing so, I run the risk of losing you before we have gotten to the subject of the book. You are liable to say: "Why are you bothering to tell me things everybody knows?" If you bear with me, you will find that what I have to say may begin with definitions but will not end there. The basic variables will not only be described and defined. They will also be measured and used. And they will enable us to solve problems we didn't know how to solve until the obvious was articulated explicitly<br><br><b><i>Desires and Beliefs</i></b><br><br>How does the customer choose among brands? She begins by assessing her options. Each brand promises her benefits. She evaluates these. In effect, she examines each offer and asks: What does this brand give me? And what does it require me to give up? The more she believes she gets, the more likely she is to choose the brand. The more she believes she must give up, the less likely she is to choose the brand. Her judgment of what she gets and what she must give up depends on her desires, on the value she places on the attributes of the brand. These desires are highly individual. One customer may consider the spiciness of a spaghetti sauce an asset; another may consider it a liability One may consider an in-flight movie an asset; another may consider it: a liability It is less obvious that beliefs are individual. The commonsense expectation is that beliefs will not lag permanently behind objective facts. But this is not necessarily so. We therefore set aside objective facts. For our purposes, there are only desires and beliefs, and both are inside the head of the customer. If we measure them properly, they will help us predict what she will buy<br><br>Desires and beliefs refer to the attributes of brands. These attributes can be organized into groups called <i>topics.</i> For a computer notebook, for example, the attributes "It weighs 1.5 pounds," "It weighs 2 pounds," and so on, can be grouped under a topic called "weight." Obviously such topics differ from product category to product category. A coffee has different topics than an airline or a fax machine or a life insurance policy Nevertheless, these different topics can be grouped under some very broad headings that cut across product categories, that constitute common denominators. These are called the <i>primary topics.</i> They will help us understand how the customer chooses. Don't expect startling revelations. In one context or another, combined and rearranged in various ways, some or all of these factors have been mentioned by just about everyone who has thought about the subject. In this particular incarnation, they are <i>product, branding, price,</i> and <i>familiarity.</i><br><br><b><i>The Primary Topics</i></b><br><br>Product attributes include attributes the customer can observe directly, as well as those she accepts on trust based on statements made to her. For example, the product attributes of an orange juice include the color and the sweetness, as well as the number of calories and the potassium content, which she may not be able to observe directly but which she accepts as factual, relying on government labeling regulations. The product attributes of a political candidate include his party and his voting record, as well as his marital status and the color of his eyes. In general, the product attributes comprise descriptions of the product and of the way it performs its principal functions.<br><br>By <i>branding</i> is meant collateral information that has been attached to the brand by external symbols: words, pictures, and music. This collateral information usually has two components: label and fable. The term <i>label</i> refers to the brand name together with the package graphics. The brand name is always part of the label, indeed its principal component by definition. Conversely, objective facts, such as 8 1/2 ounces or 320 mg of sodium per 100 grams, remain product attributes even if they appear on the label. But package graphics can belong either to the label or to the product. The graphics of a decorative facial tissue dispenser, for example, may be the very thing the customer is buying to decorate her bathroom, and hence an integral part of the product.<br><br>The following burlesque illustrates the role of label. A blue can with the name Nature-C and a red can with the name Vita-Life are filled from the same container of orange juice in the presence of a customer. We ask the customer to choose one of these "brands." She replies, "It makes absolutely no difference to me. Give me either one." But if we insist that she choose, her choice will not be random. One configuration of color and words will attract her more than the other, and that is the one she will choose. This is label at work in its purest form.<br><br>If labels are the intrinsic aspect of branding, because they consist of words and pictures that are permanently attached to the brand, fables are the extrinsic aspect of branding, because they are attached to the brand from the outside, most often by advertising. Typically, a brand is shown in close proximity to dogs, babies, boats, or undressed women, in the hope that the warm feelings customers have toward these objects will rub off on the brand and endow it with goodwill. Customers are also told overtly, ostensibly humorously, that if they buy this or that coffee, aftershave, or sailboat, they will become irresistible to the opposite sex. One particular type of fable has to do with social meanings. Buying a brand amounts to sending a message to the world, saying: "I am the kind of person who..." And this message is important to some people. We can imagine a customer who really does not like the seats, dashboard, styling, or handling of a Mercedes but buys one anyhow because she just has to have a Mercedes. Conversely, a multimillionaire might drive a beat-up pickup truck because he "wouldn't be caught dead" in his wife's Roils-Royce. To be sure, the social meanings of brands are particularly pervasive for major items, such as automobiles, homes, and jewelry, but they also operate, on a more modest scale, in the choice of coffee, toilet soap, and tennis racquets. A very special kind of fable comes into being when products are changed. For better or worse, some customers will continue to perceive products the way they were rather than the way they currently are, and they will hold beliefs about them they would not hold if they were unencumbered by associations with the past.<br><br>Everything has a price, and some brands have a higher price than others. We expect customers to prefer low prices. But like product and branding, price is individual and can have different value for different people. Upon learning that the price of a wine is five dollars per bottle, a customer asks whether the store carries anything "better," by which she means that she wants to pay more. One customer insists on buying a "real" diamond, even though neither she nor most jewelers (I am assured by a diamond dealer) can tell the difference between a diamond and a zircon with the naked eye. Another customer wants a zircon because she takes pride in making a "rational" choice. There are also choice situations in which no money changes hands -- voting for a candidate, for example. But the primary topics include price because they are intended to be comprehensive. This does not preclude the possibility that a primary topic will vanish in a particular case or will simply become nonapplicable because it has the same value for all brands.<br><br>The fourth primary topic, familiarity, is fundamentally different from the others.

When suddenly tragedy struck, the charismatic Spaffords, grieving, attracted followers eager to believe their prophecy that the Second Coming was at hand and in 1881 sailed with them to Jerusalem to see the Messiah alight on the Mount of Olives. <br><br>No sooner had they settled into the Holy City than the U. S. Consul and the established Christian missionaries declared them heretics and whispered of sexual deviance. Yet Muslims and Jews admired their unflagging care of the sick and the needy, and Jews were intrigued with their advocacy of a Jewish Return to Zion. When Horatio died, Anna assumed leadership, shocking even her adherents by abolishing marriage and established a dictatorship that was not always benevolent.

This was routine procedure, as the port of Jaffa in Palestine was notoriously unsafe. Until that moment, however, not one of the eighteen pilgrims assembled on deck had been aware of just how difficult disembarkation might be. In their haste to leave Chicago, none had thought to pack a guidebook, and they now strained to make out details of the scene before them. The town of Jaffa seemed pretty in the morning sunlight. A mosque crowned a picturesque riot of domed houses tumbling down to the sea. There was an inviting waterfront, lined with handsome brick and stone warehouses, and orange trees abounded in the countryside around the town. But the foaming waves that crashed against a circular belt of sunken boulders between them and the shore were distinctly intimidating.(1)<br><br>Neither their own steamer nor any of the other large ships anchored nearby could get close to shore. This had been so since 1345, when the Egyptian Mamluks had destroyed Jaffa's venerable harbor, determined that no infidel crusaders would ever again invade the Eastern lands after Sultan Baybars had expelled the last Western knights in 1271. Tradition had it that Andromeda was chained to one of these jagged rocks, and it was from Jaffa&#x2014;or ancient Joppa--that Jonah had fled to escape being sent to Nineveh, and then was swallowed by a whale. Hiram of Tyre sent his Lebanese cedars on floats to this port for Solomon to build his great temple in Jerusalem, and in the town itself Simon the tanner had been host to Saint Peter.<br><br>The pilgrims knew these stories. Though they lacked a guidebook, they each carried a Bible, and biblical names and characters were as familiar to them as those of their families. They were both weary and excited. They had been voyaging since August 17, when they left Chicago abruptly, after nightfall. If some had not been completely ready, none could have hesitated. The glorious message for which they had been waiting had come at last. Eagerly, they obeyed the summons. The Resurrection was at hand and they were prepared to meet the Messiah.<br><br>Thus, via Quebec by train, then by steamer to London, six women, four men, a nineteen-year-old youth, two young girls, and three babies had sailed by the northern route to Liverpool. With the addition of a retired British army captain and his wife who had asked to join them in London, the little band was now close to their hearts' desire. Soon they would be in Jerusalem to greet their Savior personally when He alighted on the Mount of Olives.<br><br>Within moments, a motley fleet of rowboats and little barges surging through the rock barrier threw their lines over the ship's side and were bobbing against its hull. A rabble of barefooted Arabs, hoisting themselves up with ropes and chains, clambered swiftly aboard, shouting incomprehensibly. Many had daggers thrust into their wide red sashes, and all seemed enormous and frightening to the startled passengers whom the captain had only recently warned of Jaffa's famously unceremonious custom of disembarkation. Clad in baggy trousers and wearing red fezzes, the boatmen fell upon passengers and baggage like a swarm of hornets, scooping men, women, children, trunks, valises, and hatboxes up in a viselike grip, and half-tossed, half-handed them over to their waiting comrades below. Finding themselves breathless and disarranged but at least safe in the heaving tenders, the ladies patted their bonnets and skirts back into order while the gentlemen offered a steadying hand. Once past the rock barrier, they were again seized by the Arab longshoremen, who carried them through the surf and up the beach, and finally set them down on Canaan's sacred soil.<br><br>Little did the pilgrims guess, as they waited for their ride over the sultan's new carriage road from Jaffa to Jerusalem, that filth, illness, and sorrow awaited them. Nor could they know of the singular friendships and rapturous moments that also lay ahead. In Chicago, the newspapers had called them the "Overcomers." Their doctrines were strange. They had been rebuffed and ridiculed for their beliefs, and for their unwavering faith in their spiritual leaders, Horatio Spafford and his blue-eyed wife, Anna. Yet educated, attractive, mostly well-to-do, and some socially prominent, these pilgrims were moved by the absolute conviction that they had been called to their journey.<br>The second half of the nineteenth century, often called America's Gilded Age, was known as "Bible drenched," and for good reason. After the recent and bloodily divisive Civil War, America had become rich, but the new wealth, resulting from an agrarian way of life giving way to an industrialized society, brought stress to many. A grand network of railroads and the Erie Canal, completed in 1825, had fueled a westward migration. Travel and the creation of new businesses had become easier, but massive dislocations followed. Suddenly there were crowded cities and an urban poor. Moreover, vast numbers of immigrants seeking work and a better life continued to arrive, bringing with them new ideas that disturbed rural America. By the middle of the tumultuous century that gave birth to the Overcomers, many made anxious by the secularism and Enlightenment thinking of the old Continent had turned to religion for reassurance and certitude.<br><br>This impulse was hardly new to America, which had already enjoyed two waves of religious "awakenings" in the past. The first had occurred four decades before the American Revolution, the second began at the start of the nineteenth century and lasted into the 1830s. Although the founding fathers, valuing freedom of conscience, had separated church from state, the country was overwhelmingly Protestant. Central to Protestantism was the belief that man needed no interceding church hierarchy to save his soul: justification was by faith, and salvation thus the responsibility of the individual alone. This liberating notion had given rise over the years to schismatic groups breaking off from mainstream churches to found their own denominations, develop their own creeds, and evangelize those in need of being "saved."<br><br>Alexis de Tocqueville, touring the country in 1831, had observed that "the prevailing passion" seemed to be "acquiring the good things of the world," but he had also been fascinated by a second powerful theme. "In the midst of American society you meet with men full of fanatical and almost wild spiritualism...From time to time strange sects arise which endeavor to strike out extraordinary paths to external happiness. Religious insanity is very common in the United States."<br>As the firewall between church and state prevented the creation of a state-supported church of the kind that existed in many European countries, individual preachers in America had to create and sustain their own congregations and develop techniques to bind them close. Conditions, therefore, were ripe for preacher-prophets to roam the land, look for converts, and win them away to their own special visions. Nothing, it seems, served as well as a revival to satisfy the Protestant's desire to embrace the Lord and lay down his burdens of sin and guilt. The country had long seen multitudes of eager seekers traveling long distances to gather in tents to be exhorted, to shout "Amen!" and to be born again. Longing to "feel" God's presence in their bodies as well as in their hearts and minds, many Protestants yearned for a dramatic baptism in the Holy Spirit. Accordingly, flourishing pentecostal movements had long been part of the American scene where overwrought believers engaged in strange, even shocking behaviors. (*)<br><br>In August 1801, at Cane Ridge, Kentucky, twenty-five thousand farmers and their families converged from their lonely mountain farms in search of religious communion. At a gathering larger than most cities of the period, and held under the auspices of Presbyterians but drawing masses from the faster-growing Methodist and Baptist denominations, men, women, and children laughed, sang, twirled, and barked like dogs until they collapsed unconscious on the ground in a trance. "These were rough people, profane, heavy drinkers, violent, who had never before attended night camp meetings. Conversion and love-making intermingled in an orgy of Pentecostal enthusiasm." (2) Reports of the bacchanal ignited a flurry of similar revivals elsewhere in the country among people equally lonely, ignorant, devoid of other entertainments, and above all bewildered by the social and economic upheavals marking the times.<br><br>The fervor famously scorched upper New York state, aptly named "the Burned-Over District" for its consecutive religious enthusiasms. Horatio Spafford was born and raised in Troy, New York, and had seen the impact of thousands of foreign immigrants converging to dig the 363-mile-long Erie Canal and rub their strange habits against staid old ways. Suddenly mills and factories stood where farms had been, and shantytowns sprawled with noisy pubs, drinking, and crime. Itinerant preachers arrived to offer consolation and their personal interpretations of Protestantism&#x2014;if in fact these could be called Protestant at all&#x2014;and the more sensational they were, the greater the number of adherents gathering to be consoled. Multitudes of sects arose. Perhaps among the best known were the celibate dancing Shakers who followed "Mother" Ann Lee in 1776, then, in 1830, Joseph Smith's polygamous Mormons, and, finally, the Oneida Perfectionists who practiced "free love" as preached by John Humphrey Noyes in 1848. Like most other sects, these products of the Burned-Over District revolved around a charismatic leader who drastically reordered traditional family relationships.<br>As nineteenth-cen...</p><h2>One Pair of Hands: Upstairs and Downstairs, Seen Through the Eyes of an Ex-Debutante Turned Cook</h2><p>&#39;Life was a wordless battle of wits between us, with her keeping a sharp look-out for signs of neglect, and me trying to disguise my slovenliness by subterfuge.

With no experience whatsoever, she gained employment as a cook-general. Monica&#39;s cooking and cleaning skills left much to be desired, and her first few positions were short lived, but soon she started to hold her own. Monica discovered the pleasure of daily banter with the milkman and grocer&#39;s boy and the joy of doing an honest day&#39;s work, all the while keeping a wry eye on the childish pique of her employers. &#34;One Pair of Hands&#34; is a fascinating and thoroughly entertaining insight into world&#39;s both upstairs and down in the early 1930s.</p><p>Monica Dickens MBE was born in 1915, and was the great-granddaughter of Charles Dickens.

I would look at the waiters and the maids at balls and know for certain that they were having a better time than I was. So I wanted to belong with them, down there where there was a bit of life.&#39; And indeed, she then spent two years as a cook and general servant. She later wrote about her experiences in her first book, One Pair of Hands (1939), which made her a bestseller at the age of twenty-two and immediately established her reputation as a writer. In her career she wrote over fifty books, including the Follyfoot novels, and for twenty years wrote a much-loved column for Woman&#39;s Own.

With the "first Drudgery" of settling the American colonies now well and truly past, Franklin announced in 1743, it was high time that the colonists set about improving the lot of humankind through collaborative inquiry. From Franklin's idea emerged the American Philosophical Society, an association hosted in Philadelphia and dedicated to the harnessing of man's intellectual and creative powers for the common good. The animus behind the Society was and is a disarmingly simple one-that the value of knowledge is directly proportional to its utility. This straightforward idea has left a profound mark on American society and culture and on the very idea of America itself-and through America, on the world as a whole.</p><p>From celebrated historian of knowledge Jonathan Lyons comes <i>The Society for Useful Knowledge</i>, telling the story of America's coming-of-age through its historic love affair with practical invention, applied science, and self-reliance.

A goal-scoring centre-forward, he was later transferred to Rangers, the club he supported from boyhood, for a Scottish record fee of GBP65,000. Entering management in 1974, he served East Stirlingshire and St Mirren before guiding Aberdeen to victory in the 1982-83 Cup Winners&#39; Cup. Arriving at Manchester United in 1986, he brought them 38 trophies, including the Club World Cup, two Champions Leagues, 13 Premier Leagues and five FA Cups. His overall haul of 49 trophies made him the most successful British manager of all time. Knighted in 1999, Sir Alex announced his retirement in 2013, when United were again crowned Premier League champions. At the age of 73, he continues to serve United as a director. In 2012 Harvard Business School created a case-study based on Sir Alex&#39;s managerial career: Sir Alex Ferguson: Managing Manchester United, and Sir Alex is now a Fellow to the Executive Education Program at Harvard. Sir Alex has published three previous books, the most recent of which, Alex Ferguson: My Autobiography became the fastest selling Non-Fiction hardback since records began, when it was published in 2013. Sir Michael Moritz Sir Michael Moritz was born in Cardiff, studied Modern History at Oxford and began his career as a journalist at Time magazine in the US in the late 1970s. It was during this period that he met the young Steve Jobs and began work on the first book about Apple, The Little Kingdom: the Private Story of Apple Computer, which was published in 1984 and has become an industry classic. Moritz co-wrote a second business book, Going for Broke: The Chrysler Story, before changing career in 1986 and joining Sequoia Capital, based in the heart of Silicon Valley, California. Sequoia Capital&#39;s close alliances with young founders have been transformed into companies now worth nearly $1.5 trillion - the most of any private, investment firm in the world. These include the first investments in companies such as Apple and Cisco and, more recently, YouTube, AirBnB, Dropbox and WhatsApp. Michael Moritz has been a member of the Board of Directors of a variety of companies including Google, Yahoo!, PayPal and LinkedIn. His work at Sequoia helped him achieve the number one listing in Forbes &#34;Midas List&#34; of the top dealmakers in the technology industry in 2006-7, and a place on the 2007 &#34;Time 100 list&#34;. In 2009, almost thirty years after it was first published, Moritz revised and expanded his book on Apple in The Return to the Little Kingdom. In 2012 he became chairman of Sequoia Capital. In 2013 he was appointed KBE in the Queen&#39;s Birthday Honours list for his services to promoting British economy and his family&#39;s philanthropic work includes the formation of Europe&#39;s largest scholarship programme for low income university students. The son of refugees from Nazi Germany, he lives in San Francisco with his wife, Harriet Heyman.This is as good as Ferguson&#39;s last book. Both are about being a particular kind of person... * Independent * Ferguson is one of the most successful men in his field - not just in football, but any sport in any era. He defied the norms and the scale of his accomplishments will only become more apparent with the passing of time. History will see that Ferguson grows, not diminishes. -- Matt Dickinson * The Times * The foundation for its (Man Utd&#39;s) success was built by Ferguson, whose near-pathological obsession with football - and with winning - is a case study in leadership. -- Lionel Barber * Financial Times * For those interested in the subject of leadership, be it managing people effectively and getting the best out of them or learning which qualities and traits separate those who manage and those who inspire, Leading is a worthwhile read. Football fans might complain that the book is over too quickly, even though Ferguson provides 343 pages of entertaining stories and observations. Structuring his sermons in an easily read format is the latest managerial masterstroke from a man who made a career out of regularly producing them. * Daily Express * LEADING is about leadership, management and the pursuit of success. It&#39;s a fantastic book, one of the best of its kind. The defining quality of Ferguson and Moritz&#39;s book is its clarity. The pair discuss leadership from a purely practical perspective, their raw material being Ferguson&#39;s vast experience. If there&#39;s one word, though, that characterises his philosophy of management it&#39;s discipline... And yet what comes through very strongly is humility, even vulnerability. Every success of his, you realise, has been hard-won. Failure has been a constant threat. Nagging anxiety he just accepted &#39;as part of my job&#39;. And he wouldn&#39;t have had it any other way. -- Marcus Berkmann * Daily Mail *</p><h2>The Whales&#39; Song</h2><p>Sweet story about whales</p><p></p><h2>The Crafter&#39;s Design Library - Celtic</h2><p>Crafters of all skill levels need an extensive selection of motifs and patterns to applly to their work.

This edition contains all of the original illustrations the author made.</b> <br><br> Walking among and studying various Native American tribes in the 19th century, the author noticed that many of the elders possessed a serene and well-preserved appearance. The young members of the true seemed especially healthy, with an innate resistance to certain illnesses and congenital conditions. Seeing the tribe's members sleeping, he noted that they all did so with closed mouths. <br><br> Catlin pondered whether this habit contributed to the physical vigor of the people, and investigated further. After venturing back to the towns of the Midwest, he attests to witnessing how terrible many people who had practiced mouth breathing throughout life appeared, and became deeply opposed to its practice. This book details how children and young people can be encouraged against mouth breathing, and notes how different the facial countenance appears between mouth breathing people and nose breathers. <br><br> Today, the notion that mouth breathing promotes physical ugliness or decrepitude is wholly disavowed as an eccentric idea with no basis in fact. However, sleep researchers have demonstrated that breathing with the mouth open while asleep can result in more snoring and thus a lower quality of sleep and therefore health. Overall, one could venture that Catlin's ideas possess a certain merit, even if his book is an exaggeration. <br><br> Although primarily known today as a painter and traveler who became an emissary of sorts to the Plains tribes, George Catlin was also an enthusiastic if occasional writer. He admired the Native American peoples for their traditions and distinctive appearance, and took to painting them - his marked talent led to their respect for his gifts, and they duly welcomed him with friendship.</p><p></p><h2>Power Training in Kung-Fu and Karate: Supplementary Exercises for Developing Explosive Power for Championship Form</h2><p>Marchini, Black Belt Hall of Fame member and top tournament competitor, demonstrates this weight-training regimen with partner and kung fu expert Leo Fong.

With these words, on September 30, 1952, the heavy red curtains in New York's Broadway Theatre opened on a panoramic Technicolor image of the Rockaways Playland Atom-Smasher Roller Coaster--and moviegoers were abruptly plunged into a new and revolutionary experience. The cinematic transformation heralded by this giddy ride was, however, neither as sudden nor as straightforward as it seemed. <i>Widescreen Cinema</i> leads us through the twists and turns and decades it took for film to change its shape and, along the way, shows how this fitful process reflects the vagaries of cultural history. </p><p> Widescreen and wide-film processes had existed since the 1890s. Why, then, John Belton asks, did 35mm film become a standard? Why did a widescreen revolution fail in the 1920s but succeed in the 1950s? And why did movies shrink again in the 1960s, leaving us with the small screen multiplexes and mall cinemas that we know today? The answers, he discovers, have as much to do with popular notions of leisure time and entertainment as with technology. Beginning with film's progress from peepshow to projection in 1896 and focusing on crucial stages in film history, such as the advent of sound, Belton puts widescreen cinema into its proper cultural context. He shows how Cinerama, CinemaScope, Vista Vision, Todd-AO, and other widescreen processes marked significant changes in the conditions of spectatorship after World War 11 -and how the film industry itself sought to redefine those conditions. The technical, the economic, the social, the aesthetic -every aspect of the changes shaping and reshaping film comes under Belton's scrutiny as he reconstructs the complex history of widescreen cinema and relates this history to developments in mass-produced leisure-time entertainment in the twentieth century. Highly readable even at its most technical, this book illuminates a central episode in the evolution of cinema and, in doing so, reveals a great deal about the shifting fit between film and society. </p></p><p><b>John Belton</b>, Assistant Professor of English at Rutgers University, is widely admired in film studies for his work with the National Film Preservation Board.

She lives in Washington State.4 MAY<br><br> Soho<br> London<br><br> First had come the requisite clothing, and her choice was simplicity itself. She already had dozens of slogan-bearing T-shirts she could wear&#x2014;only some of them being truly objectionable&#x2014;so the single purchase she made was two pairs of leggings, black in colour since black was supposed to be slimming and God knew she wanted to look slimmer than she actually was. Next, naturally, had come the footwear, with an astonishing array of choices she had absolutely&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>known could exist online or anywhere else. Black, of course, there was lots of black, but there was also the choice of beige, pink, red, silver, and white. One could have glitter as well. One could choose from soles of leather, resin, rubber, or a synthetic material of unnamed and, one hoped, eco-friendly origin. Then came the ribbons or the laces. Or the ankle straps with buckles. And finally presented were the taps themselves. Toe, toe and heel, none at all . . . although why one would purchase tap shoes without taps didn&#x2019;t make much sense to her. She ended up choosing red&#x2014;it was, after all, her signature colour when it came to footwear&#x2014;and she went with straps and buckles as she could not see herself being responsible for keeping either laces or ribbons tied for the length of time that they would need to be tied: ninety minutes each lesson.<br><br> The last thing Barbara Havers had ever expected when she&#x2019;d agreed to tap-dancing lessons in the company of Dorothea Harriman, the department secretary of her division in the Metropolitan Police, was that she would actually enjoy the activity. She&#x2019;d gone along with the plan merely because she was worn down after listening to relentlessly&nbsp;given arguments on the subject of the benefits of tap dancing as exercise. Although most forms of exercise that didn&#x2019;t involve pushing a shopping trolley up and down the aisles of the nearest Tesco had long been anathema to Barbara, she&#x2019;d fairly quickly run out of excuses on the subject of being too busy.<br> At least she&#x2019;d managed to remove Dorothea&#x2019;s hands from her love life or, more specifically, from her lack thereof. To do this, she&#x2019;d invoked the name of an Italian policeman&#x2014;Salvatore Lo Bianco&#x2014;with whom she&#x2019;d become acquainted during the previous year. That had stirred Dorothea&#x2019;s interest, which was further stirred when Barbara informed her that she was expecting a visit from Inspector Lo Bianco and his two children round Christmastime. Alas and alack, that hadn&#x2019;t happened, a sudden appendectomy performed on twelve-year-old Marco having prevented this. But wisely, Barbara hadn&#x2019;t shared her disappointment with Dorothea. As far as the departmental secretary knew, the visit had occurred and bliss of some acceptable sort was just round the corner.<br><br> Dorothea was not to be so moved regarding the tap-dancing lessons, however. Thus, for the last seven months, Barbara had found herself once each week in a dance studio in Southall, where she and Dorothea learned that a shuffle was a brush followed by a spark, a slap was a flap without the weight transfer, and a Maxie Ford involved four different movements that the faint at heart and clumsy of foot were never going to master. Nor were those individuals who did not practise daily between lessons.<br><br> At first Barbara had simply refused to practise. As a detective &nbsp;sergeant at New Scotland Yard, she did not have a plethora of open hours in which she could shuffle off to Buffalo or, frankly, to anywhere else. And while the instructor had been good enough to start his neophyte tappers gently and with mounds of encouragement, he wasn&#x2019;t entirely pleased with Barbara&#x2019;s progress, and after the tenth lesson he let her know it.<br><br> &#x201c;One must work at this,&#x201d; he told her as she and Dorothea were restoring their tap shoes to the cloth bags in which they were religiously carried every week to Southall. &#x201c;If you consider the progress that the other ladies have made and with far more impediments . . .&#x201d;<br><br> Well, yes. Of course. Righto and all that. Barbara knew he was speaking of the group of young Muslim women who were part of the class in which she and Dorothea had enrolled. They were learning to tap while still maintaining their modest garb, and the fact that more than half of them were actually able to execute a Cincinnati while Barbara could still only manage &nbsp;a simple slap was due to the fact that they did what they were told to do, which was practise, practise, practise.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bring her up to speed,&#x201d; Dorothea promised their instructor. He was called Kazatimiru&#x2014;&#x201c;You are, of course, to call me Kaz&#x201d;&#x2014;and for a recent Belarusian immigrant, he spoke astonishingly good English, with only a slight Slavic accent. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not to give up on her,&#x201d; Dorothea informed him.<br><br> Kaz, Barbara knew, was smitten with Dorothea. Men generally fell for her many charms. So when Dorothea prayed, charmingly, that his patience would hold, Kaz was warm putty in her manicured hands. Barbara reckoned she was completely off the hook at that. She could show up, mess about on the tap floor, pretend &nbsp;she knew &nbsp;what she was doing as long as she made appropriate noise with her shoes, and all would be forgiven. But she hadn&#x2019;t taken Dorothea into account.<br><br> They were going to hold post-work practice sessions, Dorothea informed her in very short order. No messing about with excuses, Detective Sergeant. There was a list of women eager to enroll in Kaz&#x2019;s class, and if Barbara Havers did not soon cut the metaphorical mustard with her tap shoes, she was as good as sacked.<br><br> It was only by swearing on the life of her mother that Barbara was able to convince Dorothea to relent. The secretary&#x2019;s plan had been to hold their practice sessions in the stairwell at work, close to the vending machines where there was room enough to shim sham, scuffle, riffle, and riff. That, Barbara had decided, was&nbsp;<i>all&nbsp;</i>she needed to complete the picture of who she was in the eyes of her colleagues. She promised she would practise nightly, and she did so. For at least a month.<br><br> She improved enough to earn Kaz&#x2019;s nod and Dorothea&#x2019;s dimpled smile. All the time she kept her dancing a secret from everyone else who touched upon her life.<br> &nbsp;<br> She&#x2019;d lost an entire stone, she found, quite effortlessly. She had to move to a smaller skirt size and the bows she tied on her drawstring trousers were getting larger by the week. Soon she would have to move to a smaller size there as well. Perhaps eventually she&#x2019;d also become the picture of lithesome beauty, she decided. Stranger things had happened.<br><br> On the other hand, that lost stone&nbsp;<i>was&nbsp;</i>the open door to tucking into curry two nights a week. &nbsp;Plus, it allowed for absolute piles of naan. Not the plain sort, mind you, but naan dripping with garlic butter, naan with butter and spices and honey and almonds, naan any way that she could find it.<br><br> She&#x2019;d been on her way to a massive weight regain when Kaz brought up the Tap Jam. This was seven months into her lessons, and she was&nbsp;thinking about dahl heaped upon naan alongside&nbsp;a lovely plate of salmon tagliatelle (she was not averse to mixing ethnicities when it came to dinner) when Dorothea said to her, &#x201c;We must go, Detective Sergeant Havers. You&#x2019;re free on Thursday night, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br> Barbara&nbsp;was&nbsp;roused from her vision of carbohydrates gone wild. Thursday night? Free? Could there ever be a different adjective applied to&nbsp;<i>any&nbsp;</i>night in her life? Dumbly, she nodded. When Dorothea cried, &#x201c;Excellent!&#x201d; and called out to Kaz, &#x201c;You can count on us!&#x201d; she should have known something was up. It was only after the lesson as they were walking to the Tube that she discovered what it was she&#x2019;d committed herself to.<br><br> &#x201c;It will be such fun!&#x201d; Dorothea exclaimed. &#x201c;And Kaz is going to be there. He&#x2019;ll stay with us on the renegade stage.&#x201d;<br><br> <i>Stage&nbsp;</i>was what informed Barbara that come Thursday night, she would have to invent a sudden debilitating illness directly related to her feet. She had, apparently, just committed herself to some kind of tap-dancing extravaganza, which was among the very last things she wanted to give a place on her bucket list.<br><br> So she made a decent attempt at excuses, touching upon fallen arches and bunions gone quite mad. Dorothea&#x2019;s response was a pretty, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even attempt to get out of this, Detective Sergeant Havers,&#x201d; and to make things worse, she let Barbara know that she was to bring her tap shoes to work on the day in question, and if she did not, Dorothea was utterly certain that Detective Sergeant Winston Nkata would be&nbsp;<i>pleased&nbsp;</i>to fetch Barbara home to get them. Or Detective Inspector Lynley. He loved going out and about in his fancy car, didn&#x2019;t he? A drive up to Chalk Farm would be the very thing.<br><br> &#x201c;All right, all right,&#x201d; had been Barbara&#x2019;s surrender. &#x201c;But if you even <i>think&nbsp;</i>I&#x2019;m planning to dance, you&#x2019;re dead wrong on a dish.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Thus she found herself in Soho on a Thursday night.<br><br> The streets were packed, not only because tourist season had officially begun, but also because the weather was pleasant and because Soho had long attracted clubbers, theatre-goers, diners, gawkers, dancers, and drinkers. So it was a case of muscling through the hordes to get to Old Compton Street. There, a club called Ella D&#x2019;s was situated.<br><br> On an upper floor of the nightclub, twice each month, a Tap Jam occurred. This, Barbara quickly discovered, comprised a Jam Mash, a Renegade Jam, and a Solo Tap, all of which she vowed&nbsp;to eschew the moment she learned what each one demanded.<br><br> The Jam Mash was already in progress when they arrived. They waited outside for a quarter hour to see if Kaz was going to show up and introduce them to the promised delights of Ella D&#x2019;s. After that, however, Dorothea announced impatiently that &#x201c;he&#x2019;s had his chance,&#x201d; and she led the way into the club where, from above their heads, they could hear music coming, along with what sounded like a herd&nbsp;of newly shoed ponies on the run.<br><br> The noise intensified as they climbed. Along with the sound of &#x201c;Big Bad Voodoo Daddy,&#x201d; they could hear a woman shouting over a microphone: &#x201c;Scuffle, scuffle! Now try a flap! Good! Now watch this.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> They hadn&#x2019;t, after all, been abandoned by Kaz. They discovered this as they entered a large room with a raised platform at one end, some two dozen chairs pushed to the walls, and a smaller crowd than Barbara would have hoped. It was clear she wasn&#x2019;t going to be able to escape notice if she mingled among them.<br><br> Kaz was on the platform with a stout-looking woman in swirly 1950s gear. No high heels, naturally, but gleaming tap shoes that she was employing to serious effect. She was calling out the steps and doing them with Kaz. Before the platform three lines of tappers were attempting to duplicate the movements.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, isn&#x2019;t this brilliant!&#x201d; Dorothea exclaimed.<br><br> For reasons obscure, she had costumed herself for this event. Whereas she had&nbsp;so far always gone to their lessons garbed in a leotard and tights&#x2014;the leotard covered over by trousers till she reached the dance floor&#x2014;tonight she&#x2019;d decided on a period kit. It featured&nbsp;a poodle skirt, a blouse tied up beneath her breasts, and a perky&nbsp;ribbon round her head � la Betty Boop. Barbara had decided it was an effort at incognito, and she wished she&#x2019;d thought along those lines herself.<br><br> Dorothea wasn&#x2019;t, however, incognito to Kaz. He clocked them within about thirty seconds, and he leapt off the platform and Cincinnatied in their direction. With the sixth sense of a seasoned dancer, he spun round just as he reached their immediate vicinity. Another two steps and he would have knocked both of them to the floor.<br><br> &#x201c;What a vision!&#x201d; he exclaimed. He was, of course, speaking of Dorothea. Barbara had gone for simplicity: trainers, leggings, and&nbsp;a T-shirt printed with I&#x2019;M NOT LAUGHING AT YOU. I JUST FORGOT TO TAKE MY MEDS.<br><br> Dorothea dimpled and brought forth a quick curtsy. She said, &#x201c;You looked&nbsp;<i>brilliant</i>!&#x201d; in clear reference to his dancing. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s she?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br> &#x201c;<i>That,</i>&#x201d; he said with some pride, &#x201c;is KJ Fowler, the number one tapper in the UK.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> KJ Fowler was still calling out the steps. When the music ended, another piece began. &#x201c;Johnny Got a Boom Boom,&#x201d; came over the speakers. Kaz said to them, &#x201c;Put your shoes on, ladies. It&#x2019;s time to buck.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> He bucked his way back to the platform, where KJ Fowler was executing a series of steps that made the efforts of those attempting to follow her look like the Underground in rush hour. Dorothea&#x2019;s eyes were alight. &#x201c;Shoes,&#x201d; she told Barbara.<br><br> At the side of the room, they put on their tap shoes. While Barbara desperately sought a believable reason for sudden paralysis, Dorothea pulled her onto the floor. A cramp roll was being executed on stage by KJ Fowler, and Kaz followed this&#x2014;upon her instruction&#x2014;with a dizzying combination of steps that only a fool would have attempted to emulate. Nonetheless there were takers, Dorothea among them. Barbara stepped to one side to observe. She had to admit it: Dorothea was good. She was, in fact, on her way to a solo. And with Barbara and the Muslim women as her main competitors, she was going to be there before she knew it.<br><br> They managed close to twenty minutes in the Jam Mash. Barbara was dripping sweat and thinking about the possibility of making an escape without Dorothea noticing when the music stopped&#x2014;for which she fervently thanked God&#x2014;and KJ Fowler informed them that time was up. At first Barbara thought this meant a blessed escape. But then KJ announced a real treat for them all. It seemed that Tap Jazz Fury were paying a visit to Ella D&#x2019;s.<br><br> Shouts and applause greeted this news as a small jazz band appeared out of nowhere. The assembled crowd got to it when the band did its stuff. Some of the dancers, Barbara had to admit, were so fleet of foot that she gave half a thought &nbsp;to continuing with tap, just to see if she could become one tenth as skilled.<br><br> It was, however, only half a thought, and it was interrupted by a vibration emanating from the area of her waistband. There she&#x2019;d tucked her mobile phone, for although she&#x2019;d committed to this Thursday evening extravaganza of tap dancing, she was still on rota. A vibrating phone meant only one thing. The job was ringing her.<br><br> She excavated for the phone and glanced at it. Detective Chief Superintendent Isabelle Ardery. She generally rang Barbara only when Barbara had committed some malefaction or another, so before answering, Barbara did a quick look-see at her conscience. It seemed clear.<br> Considering the level of noise, she knew she&#x2019;d have to take the call elsewhere, so she tapped Dorothea on the shoulder, held up the mobile, and mouthed&nbsp;<i>Ardery</i>. Dorothea wailed, &#x201c;Oh no,&#x201d; but of course she knew there was nothing for it. Barbara had to answer.<br><br> Still, she wasn&#x2019;t able to get to it before the call went to message. She shouldered her way out of the room and made for the ladies&#x2019;, down the corridor. Once inside, she listened, and the DCS&#x2019;s message was brief. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re being called off rota, ring me at once, and why the devil aren&#x2019;t you answering in the first p...</p><h2>A matter of honour</h2><p>Adam Scott listens to the reading of his father&#39;s will, knowing that all the Colonel had to leave him was an unopened letter.

When it was announced that angels would adorn the facade of the magnificent hall to be built in Fort Worth for the performing arts, the columnist, intrigued by the incongruity of angels in Cowtown, demanded, &#x201c;Where in the hell did those angels come from?&#x201d; He finally solved the dilemma by deciding they were the fallen angels of Hell&#x2019;s Half Acre, &#x201c;Irish Kate. . . on the right, and Big Birdie . . . on the left.&#x201d;<br><br>With strong affection for almost all things Texan, Flemmons writes of the ordinary with an extraordinary sophistication and cleverness. His Texas is sometimes a place of sadness, even tragedy, sometimes a place of high jinks and great jokes, but most often, it&#x2019;s a place of vanishing traditions and long- ago days. It&#x2019;s all here in this collection . . . and it&#x2019;s Flemmons at his best.<br><br>He was a pallbearer the day they buried Lee Harvey Oswald in Rose Hill Cemetery in Fort Worth. There was no one around at the brief ceremony to carry the coffin, so newspapermen performed the chore. Thereafter Marguerite Oswald, or Mama Oswald as the reporters called her, telephoned Flemmons and others with histrionic demands and telephone tirades and &#x201c;official&#x201d; announcements on the progress of her &#x201c;case.&#x201d; Flemmon&#x2019;s essay, &#x201c;Mama Oswald,&#x201d; is a compassionate and complex picture of this tormented and tragic woman.<br><br>He was there, too, when they found sniper Charles Whitman on the observation deck of the famed Tower at the University of Texas. He wrote of the slight breeze that blew that day, the play of light and shadow on the deck&#x2014;and on Whitman&#x2019;s body&#x2014;and the stunned reaction of those who found bodies on various levels of the Tower.<br><br>But Flemmons also tells lighter stories with ease, such as the one about the late Amon Carter commissioning a statue of Will Rogers on horseback, then keeping it hidden in planked boxes for eight years while World War II ran itself out. Carter couldn&#x2019;t have a proper unveiling with the war going on, so he waited. But those planks were an awful temptation to local boys.<br><br>It may be that Flemmons writes best of the small and common bits of Texas. There are essays on hunkering, that fundamental resting position for rural men, and the importance of front porches, the nostalgia of a good courthouse clock with a bell, the etiquette of the two-step, the vanishing tradition of the game &#x201c;42,&#x201d; and the inadequacy of pork barbecue.<br><br>Once he found his own private Brigadoon, a small East Texas town with a Gothic courthouse in the center of a square faced with old wooden storefronts. Old men pitched horseshoes, played dominoes or sat quietly on the worn benches on the lawn around the courthouse. Children played on the lawn and begged hard candies from the man behind the grocery store counter. Flemmons ate lunch at the caf� and a dish of ice cream at the drugstore that still boasted a counter and stools. &#x201c;To this day, I cannot remember the town&#x2019;s name, though I can recall everything about it. I have driven many miles in East Texas, searching for it, have found other towns with other courthouses and other old men, but never my town, my Brigadoon.&#x201d;</p><p>The late journalist Jerry Flemmons retired as travel editor of the <i>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</i> in the late 1990s but continued to contribute occasional columns on his favorite subject Texas.

After the Nazi invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, Aristides de Sousa Mendes found himself continually more restricted by the policies of Portugal&#39;s prime minister, Dr. Antonio Oliveira de Salazar, who, like Franco in Spain, assumed a position of neutrality but did not wish to offend Hitler. It was Salazar&#39;s Circular 14 -- which denied, on the basis of race and religion, visas to the swelling number of refugees to Portugal -- that prompted the fifty-five-year-old Sousa Mendes&#39;s first acts of disobedience in his office at the consulate in the temporary French capital of Bordeaux. Over a period of six months in 1940, in accordance with his own conscience rather than Salazar&#39;s dictates, Sousa Mendes signed many thousands of visas that spared their recipients, ten thousand of them Jews, a terrible fate in the Nazi death camps. Sousa Mendes&#39;s acts of private resistance earned him Salazar&#39;s wrath, a forced early retirement, and years of dire poverty. They also won him a place in the pantheon of truly just men and, in Israel, a forest commemorating his tremendous heroism.</p><p>A career diplomat for Portugal, Sousa Mendes was brought up in an aristocratic and pious Roman Catholic family. It is worth struggling through this stilted translation of the less-relevant first part of his life to learn about the heroic conviction he developed at the age of 55 to defy his superiors in order to save the lives of refugees from Nazism. In 1939 refugees flooded France, trying to obtain visas to Portugal, a neutral country during WWII. Portugal's prime minister, who did not want to alienate Hitler, issued "Circular 14," which effectively prohibited Portuguese consuls from fulfilling a "centuries-old tradition of hospitality" and, in explicitly excluding Jews, "officially introduced a hitherto unknown element of racial or religious segregation into the question of immigration." Finding this policy utterly unconscionable, Sousa Mendes, Portugal's consul general in France's temporary capital of Bordeaux, issued several passports to those fleeing France, and then, overwhelmed by the situation, took to his bed for three days. When he got up, he told his wife (who supported his actions) and children that God had instructed him to obey his conscience. Sousa Mendes set up a virtual assembly line and signed visas for the hordes of refugees who soon swamped his office and residence. He was eventually dismissed from the foreign service without a pension and died in poverty in 1954. Posthumously honored by Israel, he without doubt saved the lives of ten thousand Jews. Fralon, a journalist for Le Monde in Paris, renders a compelling tale of a courageous political act. 16 pages of b&amp;w photos. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>A Parisian journalist for Le Monde, Fralon tells the story of Aristides de Sousa Mendes, the Portuguese consul to France who saved thousands of Jewish lives during World War II. The book begins with Mendes's childhood, family, and career. In addition, we learn about Portugal's "neutral" policy of the time. In spite of this policy, Mendes continually assisted refugees with food and shelter but most importantly by signing thousands of visas so that they could leave the country, saving many Jews from the concentration camps. Mendes was then forced to retire, living for years in poverty. It was not until the 1980s and 1990s that his actions were officially recognized as heroic by Portugal. Mendes was not the only man to assist refugees with visas, but he is part of a small, courageous group that includes Sweden's Raoul Wallenberg and American Varian Fry. This book is written in accessible language and provides a memorable account of a man who stood up for what he thought was right. Recommended for Holocaust and World War II collections.

It describes the incandescent relationship between two hermits--a seventy-year-old monk and a fifty-year-old woman Episcopal priest and medieval scholar--who met at a Trappist monastery in Snowmass, Colorado. Both had studied Western esoteric traditions and believed it was possible for two souls to work and grow together "from here to eternity." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Brother Raphael Robin and Cynthia Bourgeault had three tempestuous and intense years together learning what it means to truly love someone, and then Rafe had a heart attack and died. Cynthia was urged to let him rest in peace (as we all are on the death of a loved one) but she trusted the invincible certainty of her heart. Several years later, Cynthia remains fully in touch with Rafe, believing that whatever he may be doing in the beyond affects her, and that what she does here affects him. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Cynthia Bourgeault's writing is robust and clear-eyed, and it shines. Her book is the story of what happened both before and after Rafe's death, as well as a guidebook for others called to the path of conscious love.</p><p>Reverend Cynthia Bourgeault was a 50-year-old priest when she met her soul mate, a hermit named Brother Raphael Robin (Rafe). They had only three years on earth together before Rafe died suddenly of a heart attack. Accounts of these earthly days together are as intense and emotionally wrenching as any love affair could be. And yet their relationship was always graced with a higher goal--creating spiritual love over romantic possession. After Rafe died, Bourgeault was content to let him rest in peace as she began her journey of grief. But weeping outdoors on a snowy night, she felt certain that Rafe's spirit was beside her. "Although I was still crying, the emotional sting started to lose its force, and a new and tingling presence began to work its way up in me, literally starting from the tips of my toes," she recalls. "I knew in that moment I was sustained by an invisible and intensely joyous partner." From then on, Bourgeault continued her love affair with Rafe. Building on this unusual, interactive love-after-death experience, Reverend Bourgeault has assembled some exquisitely reassuring thoughts and anecdotes on eternal love and the impermanence of death. This memoir could be inspirational for grieving lovers or anyone who wants to further explore the mysteries of love, death, spirit, and reincarnation. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>I've always harbored a healthy skepticism about connections with those who have departed this life, since I felt that, surely, they would now have better things to do (or perhaps not do) than stay in touch with us. However, as soon as I read Cynthia Bourgeault's account of her electrifying meeting with Brother Raphael Robin and what ensued in the three years they spent together, and then transpired after his death, I was converted. This is a love story like no other. And it is instructive for other people who feel joined to their loved ones for all eternity and yet have no model for how to stay in touch.<br><br>The world has had an increasing number of accounts recently of what happens beyond the grave but this is the first one to my knowledge that comes out of the Church and, as such, it is sure to be controversial. Still, the Reverend Bourgeault is a medieval scholar and she has done her homework well. Her book is theologically sound, as Brother David Steindl-Rast points out in his amazing foreword, "Its spirituality, far from violating monastic tradition, pushes the understanding of traditional values higher and deeper."<br>-- Toinette Lippe, editorial director of Bell Tower.</p><h2>Just Courage: God&#39;s Great Expedition for the Restless Christian</h2><p><em>"There must be more to the Christian life than this--more than church each Sunday and waving to my neighbors and giving some clothes to Goodwill when I go through my closet each spring."</em> These aren't bad things, of course.

Worse, it makes me confront myself and say: 'What am I doing to bring these people to justice and, following Jesus, set these captives free?' . . . [Haugen] makes no bones about the fact that Christians have, by and large, not done enough. There is much to be done and each day is a day to get it done. Courage is required. Christians need to move out of the safety and into the world where they might get dirty, or hurt, or run out of town. Christians must be advocates for the weak and oppressed."
